# Testing Methods

## Introduction

Testing methods are the diverse techniques used to evaluate and validate design decisions throughout the product development lifecycle. While [[Usability-Testing]] observes users completing tasks, the broader landscape of testing methods includes specialized approaches for evaluating information architecture, visual design, content, and user mental models. Each method answers different questions: Does the navigation structure make sense? Do users understand our terminology? Can they find what they're looking for? Is the first impression effective? These methods range from quick, low-cost tests (5-second tests, first-click tests) to comprehensive evaluations (usability testing, field studies).

Effective product teams use multiple testing methods strategically, choosing the right tool for the question at hand. Early in the process, you might use card sorting to understand how users mentally organize content, followed by tree testing to validate your information architecture, then first-click testing on wireframes to ensure navigation is intuitive, followed by full usability testing on high-fidelity prototypes. Each method provides unique insights that inform and improve design decisions before costly development begins.

Mastering testing methods means knowing what each technique measures, when to use it, how to conduct it properly, and how to interpret results. It's about building a testing toolkit that enables evidence-based design decisions at every stage. Testing isn't about proving your design is right—it's about learning where it's wrong so you can make it better. The best designers test constantly, using fast, lightweight methods to iterate quickly and comprehensive methods to validate critical decisions.

**Mix Methods:**
Don't rely on one method. Combine for comprehensive insights.

### Card Sorting

**What it is:**

- Participants organize content/features into categories
- Reveals user mental models
- Informs [[Information-Architecture]]

**Types:**

**Open Card Sorting:**

- Users create their own category names
- Exploratory
- Use when: Starting from scratch, want to understand user language
- **Output:** Category labels (user-generated)

**Closed Card Sorting:**

- Users sort into predefined categories
- Evaluative
- Use when: Validating existing structure
- **Output:** Agreement scores (do users agree on placement?)

**Hybrid:**

- Predefined categories + option to create new
- Flexible

**Moderated vs Unmoderated:**

- **Moderated:** In-person or video call, can ask why
- **Unmoderated:** Online tool, faster, larger sample

**Process:**

1. **Create cards:** 30-60 items (content, features, pages)

   - Keep consistent granularity
   - Use user-facing language (not internal jargon)

2. **Recruit participants:** 15-20 for open, 30+ for closed

   - Representative of target users

3. **Conduct study:**

   - Instructions: "Group these into categories that make sense to you"
   - Allow flexibility (cards in multiple categories if needed)
   - Ask participants to name categories (open sorting)

4. **Analyze results:**

   - **Dendrograms:** Hierarchical cluster diagram showing which cards were grouped together
   - **Similarity matrix:** Shows how often card pairs were grouped together
   - **Category agreement:** Do users agree on category placement?
   - **Popular category names:** Most common labels users created

5. **Apply insights:**
   - Create or refine IA
   - Use user language for navigation labels
   - Group content as users expect

**Tools:**

- Optimal Workshop (OptimalSort)
- UsabilityHub
- Miro (manual, moderated)

**Example:**
E-commerce site: Card sorting clothing items

- Open sorting reveals users group by: Occasion (work, casual, formal) vs Type (shirts, pants)
- Insight: Navigation could offer both browse paths

See [[Card-Sorting]] for deep dive.

### Tree Testing

**What it is:**

- Test [[Information-Architecture]] findability without visual design
- Text-only menu hierarchy
- Users complete tasks by navigating tree structure

**Why useful:**

- Tests structure independent of visual design
- No bias from colors, layout, images
- Quick to set up and test
- Validates IA before visual design

**Process:**

1. **Create tree:** Your site/app structure (text-only menu hierarchy)

   ```
   Home
   ├── Products
   │   ├── Clothing
   │   │   ├── Men's
   │   │   └── Women's
   │   └── Accessories
   ├── About
   └── Help
   ```

2. **Write tasks:** Where would users look to find X?

   - "Where would you look to find a women's jacket?"
   - "Where would you find information about returns?"

3. **Recruit participants:** 50+ for quantitative confidence (unmoderated, fast)

4. **Conduct test:**

   - User sees top-level menu only
   - Clicks to drill down
   - Selects final destination
   - Can backtrack if wrong path

5. **Analyze metrics:**

   - **Success rate:** % who found correct location
   - **Directness:** Did they take shortest path or backtrack?
   - **Time to complete:** How quickly?
   - **First click:** Where did they start? (if wrong, structure issue)
   - **Failure paths:** Where did failed attempts go? (reveals confusion)

6. **Refine IA:**
   - Low success rate → Reorganize, rename
   - Wrong first clicks → Parent category name unclear
   - Long paths → Consider flatter hierarchy

**Tools:**

- Optimal Workshop (Treejack)
- UsabilityHub
- Maze (supports tree testing)

**Example:**
Tree test reveals users look for "Returns Policy" under "Help," but you put it under "About."

- Insight: Move or duplicate under "Help"

### First-Click Testing

**What it is:**

- Where do users click first to complete a task?
- Tests navigation intuitiveness
- Based on research: If first click is correct, 87% likely to succeed; if wrong, 46% likely

**Why useful:**

- Quick, unmoderated
- Validates whether navigation is obvious
- Tests wireframes or mockups
- Catches major navigation issues early

**Process:**

1. **Prepare design:** Wireframe, mockup, or screenshot

2. **Write tasks:** Where would you click to...?

   - "Where would you click to see your order history?"
   - "Where would you click to change your password?"

3. **Conduct test:**

   - Show design
   - Give task
   - User clicks once
   - Record click location

4. **Analyze:**

   - **Success rate:** % who clicked correct area
   - **Click heatmap:** Where did clicks cluster?
   - **Wrong clicks:** Where did incorrect clicks go? (reveals misplaced expectations)

5. **Iterate:**
   - Low success → Navigation unclear, consider renaming, repositioning
   - Heatmap shows clicks scattered → No clear affordance
   - Wrong clicks cluster → Users expect feature elsewhere

**Tools:**

- UsabilityHub
- Lyssna (formerly UsabilityHub)
- Maze
- Optimal Workshop

**Example:**
Task: "Change your email address"

- 60% click "Settings" (correct)
- 30% click "Profile" (incorrect but logical)
- Insight: Consider renaming "Settings" to "Account Settings" or putting email under "Profile"

### 5-Second Test

**What it is:**

- Show design for 5 seconds
- Hide it
- Ask what users remember

**What it tests:**

- First impression
- Visual hierarchy (what stands out?)
- Key message comprehension
- Clarity of purpose

**Why useful:**

- Very fast (hundreds of responses in hours)
- Tests whether design communicates at a glance
- Validates hierarchy decisions

**Process:**

1. **Choose image:** Homepage, landing page, key screen

2. **Write questions:**

   - "What is this website about?"
   - "What do you remember seeing?"
   - "What was the first thing that caught your attention?"
   - "What actions could you take?" (did they see CTA?)

3. **Conduct test:**

   - Show image for 5 seconds
   - Hide image
   - Ask questions (multiple choice or open-ended)

4. **Analyze:**

   - **Recall:** What % remembered key elements (headline, CTA, logo)?
   - **First noticed:** What grabbed attention first?
   - **Message clarity:** Did they understand purpose?

5. **Iterate:**
   - Key message not recalled → Increase contrast, size, position
   - Wrong element noticed first → Adjust hierarchy
   - Purpose unclear → Simplify, clarify headline

**Tools:**

- UsabilityHub
- Lyssna
- Maze (can configure timing)

**Example:**
5-second test on landing page

- 80% recall "AI-powered analytics" headline (good)
- 20% noticed "Get Started" button (bad—too small)
- Insight: Make CTA larger, higher contrast

### A/B Testing

**What it is:**

- Compare two versions quantitatively
- Show version A to some users, B to others
- Measure which performs better on metrics

**What it tests:**

- Which design drives desired outcome (clicks, conversions, engagement)
- Specific element changes (button color, headline, layout)

**Why useful:**

- Data-driven decisions
- Measures actual behavior (not just opinions)
- Can test live traffic

**When to use:**

- Have sufficient traffic (need statistical significance)
- Testing specific, measurable change
- Post-launch optimization

**Process:**

1. **Hypothesis:** "Changing button color from blue to green will increase clicks"

2. **Create variants:**

   - Control (A): Current design
   - Variant (B): New design
   - Change ONE thing (isolated variable)

3. **Define metric:**

   - Primary: What you're optimizing (conversion rate, clicks, sign-ups)
   - Secondary: Related metrics (time on page, bounce rate)

4. **Run test:**

   - Randomly assign users to A or B
   - Equal traffic split (50/50)
   - Run until statistical significance (calculator: sample size needed)
   - Typically: Days to weeks

5. **Analyze:**

   - Which version had higher metric?
   - Is difference statistically significant? (p-value < 0.05)
   - Confidence interval

6. **Implement winner:**
   - Roll out winning version to all users
   - Document learnings

**Tools:**

- Google Optimize (free, sunset 2023, alternatives: VWO, Optimizely)
- VWO (Visual Website Optimizer)
- Optimizely
- AB Tasty
- Built into platforms (Shopify, WordPress plugins)

**Important:**

- Need large sample size (calculators online)
- Test one variable at a time (unless multivariate test)
- Avoid peeking (wait for significance)
- Consider external factors (seasonality, campaigns)

**Example:**
E-commerce checkout button

- A: Blue button "Complete Purchase"
- B: Green button "Complete Purchase"
- Result: B increased conversions by 12% (p < 0.01, significant)
- Implement: Change button to green

**Limitations:**

- Doesn't explain WHY (combine with qualitative methods)
- Requires traffic
- Can't test radically different concepts (use usability testing first)

### Guerrilla Testing

**What it is:**

- Quick, informal testing in public places
- Approach strangers (coffee shops, libraries, parks)
- Short tests (5-10 min)
- Low cost, fast feedback

**Why useful:**

- Very fast (test today, learn today)
- Low cost (buy coffee as incentive)
- Unscheduled (no recruiting logistics)
- Good for early feedback

**Limitations:**

- Participants may not match target users
- Distractions (noisy environment)
- Shorter, shallower sessions
- Less control

**Process:**

1. **Prepare:**

   - Prototype (on laptop or mobile)
   - 2-3 key tasks (quick)
   - Consent form (verbal or written)
   - Small incentive (coffee gift card)

2. **Find location:**

   - Coffee shop, library, campus, park
   - Busy but not too noisy

3. **Approach people:**

   - Polite, brief pitch: "Hi, I'm testing a design. Can I get your feedback for 5 minutes? I'll buy you a coffee."
   - Accept rejection gracefully

4. **Conduct mini-test:**

   - Brief intro (30 sec)
   - 2-3 tasks
   - Think-aloud
   - Quick debrief

5. **Repeat:** 5-10 people in an afternoon

6. **Analyze patterns:**
   - Look for consistent issues
   - Don't overweight one-off comments

**Tips:**

- Be respectful of people's time
- Test in safe, public places
- Have business cards or contact info
- Offer incentive upfront

**Example:**
Test prototype in coffee shop during lunch rush

- 6 participants in 90 minutes
- Identify 3 major navigation issues
- Iterate design same day

### Preference Testing

**What it is:**

- Show users multiple design options
- Ask which they prefer and why

**What it tests:**

- Visual design preferences
- Clarity of options
- Qualitative feedback (why)

**Process:**

1. **Create variants:** 2-4 design options (mockups, screenshots)

2. **Ask questions:**

   - "Which design do you prefer?"
   - "Why?"
   - "What stands out most in each design?"

3. **Conduct:**

   - Show all options simultaneously
   - Unmoderated (large sample) or moderated (deep dive)

4. **Analyze:**
   - % preferring each option
   - Themes in reasons (what do they value?)

**Tools:**

- UsabilityHub
- Maze
- Lyssna

**Caution:**

- Preference ≠ Usability (users may prefer pretty but unusable design)
- Use preference testing for aesthetics, not functionality
- Combine with usability testing

### Click/Tap Testing

**What it is:**

- Record where users click/tap on design
- Heatmap shows click distribution

**What it tests:**

- What elements attract clicks (perceived affordances)
- Are non-clickable elements being clicked? (false affordances)
- Are clickable elements being ignored?

**Process:**

1. **Prepare design:** Static image or interactive prototype

2. **Give task:** "Where would you click to...?" or just observe exploratory clicks

3. **Collect data:** Click coordinates

4. **Visualize heatmap:**

   - Hot spots (many clicks) = high attention
   - Cold spots = ignored

5. **Analyze:**
   - Are CTA buttons clicked? (good)
   - Are non-clickable things clicked? (confusing, false affordance)
   - Are important links ignored? (hierarchy issue)

**Tools:**

- UsabilityHub (click tests)
- Hotjar, Crazy Egg (live site heatmaps)
- Full usability platforms

**Example:**
Heatmap reveals users clicking on image thinking it's a link

- Insight: Add link to image or remove misleading visual cue

### Field Studies / Contextual Inquiry

**What it is:**

- Observe users in their natural environment
- Watch how they actually use product (or competitors)
- Understand context, interruptions, workarounds

**What it tests:**

- Real-world usage patterns
- Environmental factors
- Workflow integration
- Pain points in context

**Why useful:**

- Rich, contextual insights
- Uncover needs users can't articulate
- See workarounds and adaptations

**Limitations:**

- Time-intensive
- Expensive (travel, observation time)
- Hard to scale

**Process:**

1. **Recruit participants:** Users in target environment (office, home, etc.)

2. **Schedule visit:** 1-3 hours at their location

3. **Observe:**

   - Watch them work
   - Ask questions ("Why did you do that?")
   - Take notes, photos (with permission)

4. **Analyze:**
   - Patterns across users
   - Pain points
   - Workarounds
   - Opportunities

**Example:**
Field study in hospital (medical software)

- Observe nurses interrupted constantly, need to save/resume tasks quickly
- Insight: Design auto-save and quick resume features

### Diary Studies

**What it is:**

- Participants record experiences over time (days, weeks)
- Diary entries (text, photos, videos)
- Longitudinal data

**What it tests:**

- Long-term usage patterns
- Changes over time
- Contextual factors

**Process:**

1. **Recruit participants:** 10-20

2. **Provide diary tool:** App, journal, email

3. **Prompt entries:** Daily or triggered

   - "When did you use the app today?"
   - "What frustrated you?"

4. **Collect over time:** 1-4 weeks

5. **Analyze:**
   - Patterns over time
   - Evolving needs
   - Contextual triggers

**Tools:**

- dscout (mobile diary study platform)
- UserTesting (can configure diary studies)
- Custom (email, forms)

### Heuristic Evaluation

**What it is:**

- Experts evaluate interface against usability principles
- No users involved (expert review)

**Heuristics (Nielsen's 10):**
See [[Usability-Heuristics]]

**Process:**

1. **Assemble evaluators:** 3-5 UX experts

2. **Evaluate interface:**

   - Walk through interface
   - Identify violations of each heuristic
   - Assign severity (critical, moderate, minor)

3. **Consolidate findings:**

   - Aggregate across evaluators
   - Prioritize by severity and frequency

4. **Report:**
   - List violations with examples
   - Recommendations

**Pros:**

- Fast, cheap (no users)
- Uncovers many issues

**Cons:**

- Not actual user behavior
- Experts may not represent users
- Can miss context-specific issues

**When to use:**

- Quick audit
- Early evaluation
- Complement to user testing (not replacement)

### Combining Methods

**Example Flow:**

**Early Stage:**

1. **Card Sorting:** Understand mental models → Inform IA
2. **Tree Testing:** Validate IA structure → Refine categories
3. **Sketches/Wireframes:** Design based on IA

## Practice Exercises

1. **Card Sorting:** Choose a content-heavy website (e.g., news site, university site). Extract 40 content items. Conduct open card sorting with 5 people (friends, colleagues). Analyze: What categories emerged? What labels did users create? How would you restructure navigation?

2. **Tree Testing:** Take your card sorting results (or existing site structure). Create text-only tree. Write 5 tasks. Test with 10 people (unmoderated, UsabilityHub or Optimal Workshop). Analyze success rates. What's confusing? Refine.

3. **First-Click Test:** Find a homepage (your design or popular site). Write 3 tasks ("Where would you click to...?"). Test with 10+ people (UsabilityHub). Review heatmap. Did users click correct area? What does the heatmap reveal about visual hierarchy?

4. **5-Second Test:** Take a landing page design. Show for 5 seconds (UsabilityHub). Ask: "What is this page about?" "What actions can you take?" Test with 20+ people. Analyze: Did they get the message? What did they remember? Iterate design.

5. **A/B Test Hypothesis:** Choose an element to test (button color, headline, CTA placement). Write hypothesis ("Changing X will increase Y"). Create 2 variants. Define primary metric. Calculate sample size needed (online calculator). Explain how you'd analyze results.

6. **Method Selection:** For each scenario, choose the best testing method and explain why:
   - You're redesigning navigation for an e-commerce site
   - You want to know if users notice your "Sale" badge
   - You need to compare two checkout flow designs
   - You're evaluating if your dashboard is usable
   - You want to understand how accountants use your software in the field
