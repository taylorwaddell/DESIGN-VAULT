## üí° Tips for Success

**Document as You Go**

- Take screenshots of your work-in-progress
- Keep notes on decisions and rationales
- Save multiple iterations (shows growth)
- These become case study materials later

**Practice Deliberately**

- Don't just read‚Äîdo the exercises in each topic
- Rebuild existing interfaces to understand patterns
- Start small, increase complexity gradually
- Share work for feedback regularly

**Build in Public**

- Join design communities (Dribbble, Behance, local meetups)
- Share work-in-progress (not just finals)
- Give feedback to others (teaches you to critique)
- See [[Networking]] and [[Feedback-and-Critique]]

**Create Real Projects**

- Personal projects (solve your own problems)
- Volunteer work (nonprofits, small businesses)
- Freelance (when ready)
- Real constraints = real learning

**Embrace Iteration**

- First attempts won't be perfect (that's normal)
- Feedback is a gift (not criticism)
- V1 ‚Üí V2 ‚Üí V3... ‚Üí Good work
- See process in [[Capstone-Project]]
