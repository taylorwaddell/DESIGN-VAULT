# UX Writing

## Introduction

UX writing is the practice of crafting the words users encounter when interacting with digital products—button labels, error messages, form instructions, onboarding prompts, empty states, tooltips, and more. While visual design directs attention and interaction design enables actions, words clarify meaning, set expectations, reduce anxiety, and build trust. Good UX writing is invisible—users complete tasks effortlessly without noticing the careful word choices that guided them. Bad UX writing is obvious—confusing instructions, vague errors, robotic tone—creating frustration and abandonment.

UX writing differs from marketing copy or long-form content. It's concise (every word counts), contextual (tied to specific moments in the user journey), and functional (helps users complete tasks). A UX writer collaborates closely with designers, product managers, and developers, ensuring that words and visuals work together harmoniously. They consider voice and tone (brand personality), clarity (is it understandable?), and empathy (does it acknowledge user emotions?). A well-written error message turns frustration into reassurance; a clear button label turns hesitation into confidence.

Mastering UX writing means understanding when to write (not every screen needs words), what to write (essential information only), and how to write (clear, conversational, appropriate tone). It's about knowing your users (what language do they use?), anticipating their needs (what questions will they have?), and testing your words (do users understand?). UX writing is not an afterthought or a designer's side task—it's a specialized skill that shapes user experience as much as layout, color, and interaction.

## Learning Objectives

By mastering UX Writing, you will be able to:

- Write clear, concise microcopy for UI components
- Establish and apply consistent voice and tone
- Craft effective error messages and feedback
- Write accessible, inclusive interface text
- Create user-centered button labels and CTAs
- Develop content guidelines for design systems
- Collaborate effectively with designers and developers
- Test and iterate on interface copy

## Key Knowledge Points

### What is UX Writing?

**Definition:**
UX writing is the practice of crafting the words users read and interact with in digital products—buttons, labels, instructions, errors, notifications, empty states, onboarding flows, etc.

**Also Called:**

- Microcopy
- Product writing
- Interface writing
- Content design

**Where UX Writing Appears:**

- **Button labels:** "Save," "Continue," "Delete account"
- **Form labels and placeholders:** "Email address," "Enter your name"
- **Helper text:** "Your password must include 8 characters"
- **Error messages:** "We couldn't process your payment. Please check your card details."
- **Success messages:** "Your profile was updated successfully"
- **Empty states:** "No messages yet. Start a conversation!"
- **Onboarding:** "Welcome! Let's set up your account in 3 steps."
- **Confirmation dialogs:** "Are you sure you want to delete this? This action cannot be undone."
- **Tooltips:** "This setting controls email notifications"
- **Navigation labels:** "Home," "Settings," "Profile"

**UX Writing vs Other Writing:**

|             | UX Writing                   | Marketing Copy       | Long-Form Content    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Purpose** | Guide users, reduce friction | Persuade, sell       | Educate, inform      |
| **Length**  | 1-10 words                   | Varies               | 100s-1000s of words  |
| **Tone**    | Clear, helpful               | Exciting, persuasive | Informative          |
| **Context** | In-product                   | Ads, landing pages   | Blog posts, articles |

### Why UX Writing Matters

**Clarity:**

- Poor copy = confusion, errors, support tickets
- Good copy = users understand and succeed

**Efficiency:**

- Users scan, don't read deeply
- Concise copy = faster comprehension

**Trust:**

- Clear, honest language builds trust
- Vague, robotic language erodes trust

**Accessibility:**

- Clear language benefits users with cognitive disabilities, non-native speakers, low literacy
- Screen readers read interface text aloud (if unclear, user stuck)

**Conversion:**

- Button label changes can impact conversion rates
- "Get started free" vs "Sign up" = different perception

**Brand:**

- Voice and tone communicate brand personality
- Friendly, formal, playful, professional?

**Example Impact:**

**Before:** "Error: Invalid input"

- **Problem:** What's invalid? What should user do?

**After:** "Please enter a valid email address (e.g., name@example.com)"

- **Better:** Specific error, example provided, user knows what to fix

### Voice and Tone

**Voice = Brand Personality (Consistent):**
Your brand's personality. Stays the same across all contexts.

**Examples:**

- **Mailchimp:** Friendly, fun, slightly quirky
- **Stripe:** Professional, clear, direct
- **Duolingo:** Playful, encouraging, slightly sarcastic
- **Apple:** Simple, confident, elegant

**Tone = Emotional Adaptation (Changes with Context):**
How voice adjusts to different situations.

**Example: Mailchimp**

- **Success:** "High five! Your campaign is on its way." (Celebratory)
- **Error:** "We couldn't send your campaign. Here's how to fix it." (Helpful, not joking)

**Matching Tone to Context:**

| Context                       | User Feeling                   | Tone                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Onboarding                    | Curious, maybe overwhelmed     | Welcoming, reassuring, simple     |
| Success message               | Accomplished                   | Celebratory (but don't overdo)    |
| Error message                 | Frustrated, confused           | Empathetic, helpful, clear        |
| Payment failed                | Anxious, concerned             | Calm, reassuring, actionable      |
| Confirmation (delete account) | Uncertain                      | Serious, clear about consequences |
| Empty state                   | Neutral, looking for next step | Encouraging, guiding              |

**Example: Payment Failed**

**Wrong Tone (Jokey):**
"Oops! Your payment went on vacation. Try again?"

- **Problem:** User is anxious about money, joke feels tone-deaf

**Right Tone (Reassuring):**
"We couldn't process your payment. Please check your card details or try a different payment method."

- **Better:** Clear, calm, actionable

**Establishing Voice & Tone:**
Document voice characteristics and how they adapt.

**Example:**

- **Voice:** Friendly, professional, clear
- **Tone Guidance:**
  - **Success:** Celebratory but not over-the-top ("Great! Your changes were saved.")
  - **Error:** Empathetic, helpful, solution-focused ("We couldn't find that page. Try searching or go to the homepage.")
  - **Instructions:** Simple, step-by-step ("First, choose a template. Then, add your content.")

### Principles of Good UX Writing

**1. Clarity:**

- Use simple words
- Avoid jargon, technical terms (unless audience is technical)
- Be specific (not vague)

**❌ Vague:** "An error occurred"
**✅ Clear:** "We couldn't save your changes. Please try again."

**2. Conciseness:**

- Every word should earn its place
- Remove filler

**❌ Wordy:** "In order to proceed, you will need to click on the button below"
**✅ Concise:** "Click Continue"

**3. Conversational:**

- Write like you speak (to a degree)
- Avoid robotic, overly formal language
- Use contractions (we're, don't, you'll)

**❌ Robotic:** "The system has encountered an error"
**✅ Conversational:** "We ran into a problem"

**4. Actionable:**

- Tell user what to do next
- Especially in errors: How to fix?

**❌ Not actionable:** "Invalid password"
**✅ Actionable:** "Your password must be at least 8 characters"

**5. Empathetic:**

- Acknowledge user feelings
- Don't blame user

**❌ Blaming:** "You entered the wrong password"
**✅ Empathetic:** "That password didn't work. Try again or reset your password."

**6. Consistent:**

- Use same terms throughout product
- If it's "Settings" in nav, don't call it "Preferences" elsewhere

**7. User-Focused:**

- Use "you" and "your" (not "my" or "user's")
- Focus on user benefit

**❌ System-focused:** "Save settings"
**✅ User-focused:** "Save your preferences"

**8. Scannable:**

- Users scan, not read
- Use bullets, short paragraphs, clear headings

### Writing Effective Button Labels

**Buttons are calls to action (CTAs)—they trigger actions.**

**Principles:**

**1. Start with Verb:**
Buttons DO something.

**✅ Good:**

- "Save changes"
- "Continue"
- "Delete account"
- "Send message"

**❌ Avoid:**

- "OK" (what does it do?)
- "Submit" (submit what?)
- "Yes" / "No" (unclear out of context)

**2. Be Specific:**
What exactly happens?

**❌ Generic:** "Submit"
**✅ Specific:** "Create account"

**❌ Generic:** "Continue"
**✅ Specific (when helpful):** "Continue to payment"

**3. Keep Short (1-3 words):**
Users scan quickly.

**✅ Good:**

- "Sign in"
- "Add to cart"
- "Learn more"

**❌ Too long:**

- "Click here to submit your form and continue to the next step"

**4. Match Tone:**

**Formal product:** "Proceed to checkout"
**Casual product:** "Let's go!"

**5. Primary vs Secondary:**

**Primary button** (main action): "Save changes"
**Secondary button** (alternative): "Cancel"

Visual hierarchy (primary more prominent) + label clarity = user knows which is main action.

**6. Confirmation Dialogs:**

**Context matters:**

**Dialog:** "Are you sure you want to delete this file?"
**Button labels:**

- ✅ **Good:** "Delete" / "Cancel" (clear consequence)
- ❌ **Bad:** "Yes" / "No" (requires re-reading dialog)

**Destructive Actions:**
Make clear, use caution.

**Example:** Delete Account

- **Label:** "Delete account" (not "OK")
- **Color:** Red (danger)
- **Confirmation:** "Type DELETE to confirm" (prevent accidental clicks)

### Writing Error Messages

**Errors are frustrating. Good error messages reduce frustration.**

**Anatomy of Good Error Message:**

**1. What went wrong:**
Be specific.

**❌ Vague:** "Error"
**✅ Specific:** "We couldn't process your payment"

**2. Why it happened (if helpful):**
Sometimes knowing why helps user fix it.

**✅ "Your session expired. Please sign in again."**

**3. What to do next:**
How to fix?

**✅ "Please check your card details and try again."**

**Examples:**

**Generic Error:**
**❌ "Error 500: Internal Server Error"**

- **Problems:** Technical jargon, not actionable, doesn't reassure

**Better:**
**✅ "Something went wrong on our end. We're working on it. Please try again in a few minutes."**

- **Better:** Plain language, reassures (not user's fault), actionable (try again later)

**Form Validation Error:**
**❌ "Invalid email"**

- **Problems:** What's invalid? How to fix?

**Better:**
**✅ "Please enter a valid email address (e.g., name@example.com)"**

- **Better:** Specific, example provided

**Password Error:**
**❌ "Password incorrect"**

- **Problems:** Feels blaming

**Better:**
**✅ "That password didn't work. Try again or reset your password."**

- **Better:** Neutral tone, offers solution (reset)

**Best Practices:**

**Do:**

- ✅ Be specific (what went wrong?)
- ✅ Be helpful (how to fix?)
- ✅ Be empathetic (acknowledge frustration)
- ✅ Offer next steps (link to help, contact support)
- ✅ Use plain language (not error codes)

**Don't:**

- ❌ Blame user ("You did X wrong")
- ❌ Use jargon or error codes alone
- ❌ Be vague ("Something went wrong")
- ❌ Leave user stuck (no next step)

**Error Messages and Accessibility:**

- Use `aria-describedby` to link input to error message
- Mark field as `aria-invalid="true"`
- Error icon + text (not just color)
- See [[Accessibility]]

### Writing Helper Text and Instructions

**Helper text explains how to use a field or feature.**

**Where:**

- Below form fields
- In tooltips
- In onboarding
- In empty states

**Examples:**

**Password Field:**
**Helper text:** "Must be at least 8 characters and include a number"

- Clear requirements upfront (before user types)

**Search Field:**
**Placeholder:** "Search for products, articles, or help"

- Examples guide user

**Empty State:**
"No projects yet. Create your first project to get started."

- Explains why empty, guides next action

**Onboarding:**
"We'll ask you a few questions to personalize your experience. This takes about 2 minutes."

- Sets expectations (how long, why)

**Best Practices:**

**1. Be Upfront:**
Provide instructions before user makes mistake (not after).

**2. Use Examples:**
Show format or content type.

**✅ "Enter your phone number (e.g., 555-123-4567)"**

**3. Explain Why:**
If not obvious, explain why you're asking.

**✅ "We'll use this to send order updates"**

**4. Keep Short:**
1-2 sentences maximum (users won't read long explanations).

**5. Don't Repeat Label:**

**❌ Label:** "Email address"
**❌ Helper:** "Enter your email address"

- **Problem:** Redundant

**✅ Helper:** "We'll send you order confirmations here"

- **Better:** Adds context

### Writing for Accessibility and Inclusion

**Accessible Language:**

**1. Use Plain Language:**

- Short sentences
- Common words (not jargon)
- Active voice
- Benefits: cognitive disabilities, non-native speakers, low literacy

**❌ Complex:** "In order to facilitate the completion of your transaction, you must authenticate your credentials."
**✅ Plain:** "To finish, sign in to your account."

**2. Don't Rely on Color Alone:**
"Click the green button" → What if user is colorblind?

**✅ Better:** "Click the Save button"

**3. Provide Context for Icons:**
Icon-only buttons need accessible labels.

```html
<button aria-label="Close">
  <IconX />
  <!-- X icon -->
</button>
```

Screen reader reads: "Close button"

**4. Avoid Directional Language (if possible):**
"Click the button on the right" → What if screen reader user can't see layout?

**✅ Better:** "Click the Save button"

**Inclusive Language:**

**1. Use Gender-Neutral Language:**

- ❌ "Every user should update his profile"
- ✅ "Every user should update their profile"
- ✅ "Update your profile"

**2. Avoid Ableist Language:**

- ❌ "Crazy," "insane," "lame," "blind to"
- ✅ Alternatives: "Surprising," "intense," "broken," "unaware of"

**3. Avoid Culturally-Specific Idioms:**
May not translate well.

- ❌ "Hit a home run" (baseball reference, not universal)
- ✅ "Succeeded" (clear to all)

**4. Use Appropriate Terminology:**

- "People with disabilities" (not "disabled people")
- "They/them" pronouns if gender unknown

**5. Be Sensitive to Context:**
Example: Encouraging language for weight tracking app

- ❌ "You've been slacking! Get back on track!"
- ✅ "Welcome back! Ready to log today's activity?"

**Readability:**

**Aim for 6th-8th Grade Reading Level:**

- Tools: Hemingway Editor (hemingwayapp.com), Readable (readable.com)
- Check: Are sentences short? Is vocabulary simple?

**Benefits:**

- Easier for everyone (including experts—they're busy, too)
- Better for non-native speakers
- Better for cognitive accessibility

### Empty States

**Empty states appear when there's no content—inbox with no messages, cart with no items, etc.**

**Purpose:**

- Explain why empty
- Guide user to next action (how to add content)
- Encourage engagement

**Bad Empty State:**
"No results"

- **Problem:** Vague, not helpful

**Good Empty State:**
"No messages yet. Start a conversation with your team!"

- **Better:** Explains empty, suggests action

**Examples:**

**Empty Inbox:**
"You're all caught up! No new messages."

- Positive framing (caught up, not "empty")

**Empty Cart:**
"Your cart is empty. Browse products to get started."

- Clear state, actionable

**Search with No Results:**
"No results for 'XYZ'. Try a different search term or browse categories."

- Explains, offers alternatives

**New User (no projects yet):**
"Welcome! Let's create your first project."

- Welcoming, guides next step

**Components:**

1. **Heading:** Brief description of state ("No messages yet")
2. **Body (optional):** More context or encouragement
3. **Visual (optional):** Illustration (not essential, sometimes helps)
4. **Call-to-Action:** Button or link guiding next action ("Create project")

### Confirmation Dialogs

**When to Use:**
User about to take significant or destructive action (delete, irreversible change).

**Anatomy:**

**1. Heading:**
Question or clear statement.

**✅ "Delete this file?"**
**✅ "Are you sure you want to leave?"**

**2. Body:**
Explain consequences.

**✅ "This will permanently delete 'report.pdf'. This action cannot be undone."**

**3. Buttons:**
Clear labels (specific to action).

**✅ "Delete" / "Cancel"**
**❌ "Yes" / "No"** (requires re-reading heading)

**Destructive Actions:**
Use visual cues + extra confirmation.

**Example: Delete Account**

- Red button
- Text input: "Type DELETE to confirm"
- Clear consequence: "This will permanently delete your account and all data."

**Non-Destructive Confirmations:**
Use sparingly (don't confirm every action, fatigues users).

**Example: Save Changes?**
If user navigating away with unsaved changes:
**Dialog:** "You have unsaved changes. Do you want to save before leaving?"
**Buttons:** "Save" / "Discard" / "Cancel"

### Success Messages

**When user completes action, confirm it.**

**Purpose:**

- Reassurance (action worked)
- Close feedback loop

**Examples:**

**✅ "Your profile was updated"**
**✅ "Message sent"**
**✅ "Payment successful"**

**Where:**

- Toast notification (temporary overlay)
- Inline message (near action)
- New page (confirmation page after checkout)

**Tone:**
Celebratory (but not over-the-top).

**✅ "All set! Your changes were saved."**
**✅ "You're in! Welcome to your account."**

**Avoid:**
❌ Overly enthusiastic for minor actions:
"AMAZING!!! YOU CLICKED A BUTTON!!!" (too much)

### Loading States

**When action takes time (loading, processing), show progress.**

**Microcopy:**

- "Loading..."
- "Processing your payment..."
- "Uploading file..."
- "Just a moment..."

**Progress Indicators:**
If you can estimate time, show progress bar + percentage.

**Long Waits:**
Provide context.

**✅ "This may take up to 2 minutes. We're processing your order."**

**Avoid:**
Leaving user in the dark (no indicator, no message = user thinks it broke).

### Notifications

**Types:**

**1. Transactional:**
Confirmations, receipts, account updates.

- Tone: Clear, straightforward
- Example: "Your password was changed."

**2. Promotional:**
Marketing, feature announcements.

- Tone: Engaging, benefit-focused
- Example: "New feature: Export your data to CSV!"

**3. Alerts:**
Errors, warnings, urgent info.

- Tone: Clear, urgent (but not alarming unless truly critical)
- Example: "Your subscription expires in 3 days. Renew now."

**Best Practices:**

- **Subject/Heading:** Clear what it's about
- **Body:** Brief, actionable
- **CTA:** Clear next step ("Renew subscription")

**Avoid:**

- Overuse (notification fatigue)
- Vague subjects ("Update")

### Content Guidelines for Design Systems

If you're building a [[Design-Systems]], document UX writing guidelines.

**Include:**

**1. Voice & Tone:**

- Brand voice characteristics (friendly, professional, etc.)
- Tone adjustments by context (success, error, etc.)
- Examples

**2. Grammar & Mechanics:**

- Capitalization (sentence case vs title case)
- Punctuation (periods in short UI text?)
- Contractions (use them or not?)
- Numbers (spell out or numerals?)
- Abbreviations

**Example:**

- **Button labels:** Sentence case, no period ("Save changes")
- **Error messages:** Full sentences, periods. ("We couldn't process your request. Please try again.")

**3. Terminology:**
Consistent terms across product.

**Example:**

- Use "sign in" (not "log in")
- Use "settings" (not "preferences")

**4. Component-Specific Guidance:**

**Buttons:**

- Start with verb
- 1-3 words
- Examples: "Save," "Continue," "Add to cart"

**Error Messages:**

- What went wrong + how to fix
- Empathetic tone
- Plain language

**Form Labels:**

- Clear, concise
- No colons (modern style)
- Example: "Email address" (not "Email address:")

**Empty States:**

- Explain why empty
- Suggest action
- Example: "No messages yet. Start a conversation!"

**5. Dos and Don'ts:**
Visual examples of correct and incorrect copy.

**✅ Do:** "Save your changes"
**❌ Don't:** "OK"

**6. Accessibility:**

- Use plain language
- Provide context for icon-only buttons
- Don't rely on color alone

See [[Design-System-Documentation]]

### Testing UX Writing

**How to Know if Your Copy Works?**

**1. Usability Testing:**

- Watch users interact with product
- Do they understand instructions?
- Do they know what buttons do?
- Do they get stuck?
- See [[Usability-Testing]]

**2. A/B Testing:**

- Test two versions of copy
- Measure: Clicks, conversions, task completion

**Example:**

- Button A: "Sign up"
- Button B: "Get started free"
- Which gets more clicks?

**3. Analytics:**

- High error rate on a form? Instructions unclear?
- Drop-off on a page? CTA unclear?

**4. Surveys:**
Ask users directly.

**Example:**
"Was this error message helpful?"

- Yes / No
- If no: "What was unclear?"

**5. Readability Tools:**
Hemingway Editor, Readable.com

- Checks reading level, sentence complexity
- Aim for 6th-8th grade level

**6. Read Aloud:**
Does it sound natural?
If awkward to say, rewrite.

**7. Screen Reader Testing:**
Use screen reader (VoiceOver, NVDA)
Does copy make sense without visual context?

### Collaborating with Designers and Developers

**UX Writer's Role:**

**With Designers:**

- Review wireframes, mockups early (before finalized)
- Suggest copy length (will it fit?)
- Ensure visual hierarchy supports copy (most important words prominent?)

**With Developers:**

- Provide final copy before development starts
- Document copy in design system / component library
- Clarify context for dynamic text (e.g., pluralization rules: "1 item" vs "2 items")

**With Product Managers:**

- Understand user needs, product goals
- Align copy with product strategy

**With Researchers:**

- Use research insights (what language do users use?)
- Test copy with users

**Process:**

**Early:**

- Involved in wireframing (rough copy, set direction)
- Copy isn't final, but establishes tone, structure

**Mid:**

- Finalize copy for high-fidelity designs
- Review with designer (does it fit? Is hierarchy clear?)

**Late:**

- Copy implemented in code
- Review in live product (does it work in context?)

**Tools:**

- Design files (Figma): Write copy in designs
- Spreadsheets: Track copy for localization
- Design system documentation: Document content guidelines
- Content management system (CMS): Manage marketing copy

### Common UX Writing Mistakes

**1. Too Vague:**
❌ "Error occurred"
✅ "We couldn't save your changes. Please try again."

**2. Too Wordy:**
❌ "In order to proceed to the next step, please click the button below"
✅ "Click Continue"

**3. Jargon / Technical Terms:**
❌ "Authentication failed"
✅ "We couldn't sign you in. Check your email and password."

**4. Inconsistent Terminology:**
Calling same thing different names ("Settings" vs "Preferences" vs "Options")

**5. Not User-Focused:**
❌ "System will update"
✅ "We're updating your account"

**6. Blaming User:**
❌ "You entered the wrong password"
✅ "That password didn't work. Try again."

**7. Not Actionable:**
❌ "Invalid input"
✅ "Please enter a valid email address"

**8. Wrong Tone for Context:**
❌ Jokey error when user is anxious (payment failed)
✅ Calm, reassuring tone

**9. Forgetting Accessibility:**
❌ Icon-only button with no accessible label
✅ Button with `aria-label`

**10. Not Testing:**
Assuming copy is clear without user testing

### Best Practices

**Do:**

- ✅ Use clear, simple language
- ✅ Be concise (every word earns its place)
- ✅ Write conversationally (contractions, active voice)
- ✅ Be specific (not vague)
- ✅ Be empathetic (acknowledge user feelings)
- ✅ Be consistent (same terms throughout)
- ✅ Focus on user benefit (not system actions)
- ✅ Make copy scannable (short paragraphs, bullets)
- ✅ Test with users (does it work?)
- ✅ Collaborate early (writers, designers, developers)

**Don't:**

- ❌ Use jargon or technical terms (unless audience is technical)
- ❌ Be vague ("Error," "Something went wrong")
- ❌ Be wordy (cut fluff)
- ❌ Blame user ("You did X wrong")
- ❌ Leave user stuck (always provide next step)
- ❌ Forget accessibility (plain language, context for icons)
- ❌ Assume your copy is perfect (test it!)

## Practice Exercises

1. **Rewrite Bad Copy:** Find 5 examples of poor UX writing (vague errors, confusing buttons, robotic tone). For each:

   - Identify problems
   - Rewrite with better copy
   - Explain why your version is better
     Present before/after with analysis.

2. **Write Error Messages:** For each scenario, write a clear, helpful error message:

   - User enters wrong password (3rd attempt)
   - User's credit card payment fails
   - User tries to delete a file but lacks permission
   - User's session expired
   - Internet connection lost during upload
     Apply: Clear explanation, how to fix, empathetic tone.

3. **Button Label Audit:** Choose an app or website. Find 10 buttons. Evaluate each label:

   - Is it specific? (Or generic like "Submit"?)
   - Does it start with a verb?
   - Is it concise?
   - Is tone appropriate?
     Rewrite any poor labels. Present findings in table (Original | Issues | Improved).

4. **Voice & Tone Guide:** Create a mini voice and tone guide for a hypothetical product (choose: banking app, fitness app, or children's education app):

   - Define voice (3 adjectives: e.g., friendly, professional, clear)
   - Describe tone for 3 contexts: success, error, onboarding
   - Provide 3 example sentences for each context
     1-2 pages.

5. **Empty State Copy:** Write microcopy for 5 empty states:

   - Empty inbox
   - Empty shopping cart
   - Empty search results
   - New user with no projects
   - No notifications
     For each: Heading + brief body + CTA button label.

6. **Usability Test Copy:** Choose a form or flow in a product you use. Test copy with 3 people:
   - Ask them to complete task
   - Observe: Do they understand instructions? Do they hesitate at any copy?
   - Ask: "What did you think that button would do?" (Do labels match expectations?)
     Note findings and suggest improvements.
