# Capstone Project

## Introduction

The Capstone Project is where everything comes together—a comprehensive design challenge that integrates the visual fundamentals, UI design skills, UX research methodologies, prototyping techniques, and design systems thinking you've developed throughout this learning journey. Unlike isolated exercises that focus on single skills, a capstone project mirrors real-world design work: messy, complex, requiring trade-offs, collaboration, iteration, and strategic thinking. It's your opportunity to demonstrate mastery not just of individual techniques, but of the entire design process from research through delivery.

A strong capstone project doesn't just result in pretty mockups—it tells a story of problem-solving. It begins with understanding user needs through research, translates those insights into information architecture and user flows, explores solutions through wireframing and ideation, refines the experience with high-fidelity design and prototyping, and documents the system with design tokens and component libraries. The final deliverable is a case study that walks viewers through your thinking, decisions, challenges, and outcomes. This becomes a centerpiece of your portfolio, demonstrating to potential employers or clients that you can handle the full complexity of design work.

Approaching your capstone strategically means choosing a project scope that's ambitious but achievable, setting clear goals and success criteria, managing your time effectively, seeking feedback iteratively, and documenting your process thoroughly. The project should showcase your strengths while addressing areas for growth. Whether you're redesigning an existing product, creating something new, or tackling a social impact challenge, your capstone is proof that you don't just know design theory—you can apply it to solve real problems for real people.

## Key Knowledge Points

### What is a Capstone Project?

**Definition:**
A comprehensive design project that demonstrates your ability to apply the full UX/UI design process—from research and strategy through final deliverables and documentation.

**Purpose:**

- **Integration:** Combine all skills learned (research, IA, visual design, prototyping, systems)
- **Demonstration:** Prove you can handle real-world design challenges
- **Portfolio:** Create centerpiece for your design portfolio
- **Learning:** Discover how design phases connect and inform each other
- **Confidence:** Build confidence in your abilities through successful completion

**Typical Scope:**

- **Duration:** 4-8 weeks (part-time), 2-4 weeks (full-time)
- **Deliverables:** Research findings, IA/flows, wireframes, high-fidelity designs, interactive prototype, design system components, case study
- **Complexity:** Multi-screen experience (not single screen), real user problem (not trivial)

**Examples:**

- Redesign of an existing app (e.g., improve Airbnb booking flow)
- New product concept (e.g., meal planning app for busy parents)
- Social impact project (e.g., mental health resource finder)
- Enterprise tool (e.g., project management dashboard)

### Choosing Your Project

**Criteria for Good Capstone:**

**1. Real Problem:**
Solves actual user pain point (not made-up problem).

**How to Find:**

- Your own frustrations ("I wish there was an app for...")
- Friends/family struggles (interview them)
- Observe gaps in market
- Social issues you care about

**2. Appropriate Scope:**
Not too simple, not too complex.

**Too Simple:**

- Single-screen app
- Minor UI refresh
- "Design a login screen"

**Too Complex:**

- Entire platform with 50 features
- Operating system redesign
- Unrealistic timeline

**Just Right:**

- 3-8 key screens
- 1-3 primary user flows
- Clear, focused problem

**Example Scopes:**

**Good:**
"Redesign the checkout flow for an e-commerce app (cart → shipping → payment → confirmation)"

- Focused, 4-5 screens, clear problem (reduce abandonment)

**Good:**
"Design a budgeting app for college students (onboarding → add expenses → view spending → set goals)"

- Clear audience, 5-7 screens, specific user need

**Too Broad:**
"Design a social media platform"

- Too many features, competing with giants, unclear focus

**3. Demonstrable:**
You can show your work (before/after, prototypes, research).

**4. Interesting to You:**
You'll spend weeks on this—choose something you care about.

**Project Types:**

**Redesign:**
Improve existing product.

- **Pros:** Existing product to analyze, identify problems
- **Cons:** Need to justify changes (why is current design bad?)
- **Example:** "Redesign Goodreads book tracking interface"

**New Product:**
Create something that doesn't exist.

- **Pros:** More creative freedom, show innovation
- **Cons:** Need to validate need (does anyone want this?)
- **Example:** "Design a local event discovery app for introverts"

**Social Impact:**
Address social/environmental issue.

- **Pros:** Meaningful, shows values, can be portfolio differentiator
- **Cons:** May require more research, complexity
- **Example:** "Design an app helping low-income families find food assistance"

**Recommendation for Beginners:**
Redesign of existing product (easier to identify problems, less ambiguous).

7. Case study

---

**Why This Matters:**

- Clarifies scope (prevents scope creep)
- Guides decision-making (refer back when stuck)
- Communicates intent (share with mentors, peers)

### Phase 1: Research and Discovery

**Goal:** Understand the problem, users, and context.

**Activities:**

**1. User Research:**
Who are your users? What are their needs, goals, frustrations?

**Methods:**

- **User interviews:** 5-8 people (see [[User-Interviews]])
- **Surveys:** Larger sample, quantitative data (see [[Surveys]])
- **Observation:** Watch users with existing solutions (if redesign)
- **Secondary research:** Articles, reports, competitive analysis

**Deliverables:**

- Interview transcripts/notes
- Key insights (themes, quotes)
- Personas (1-3) (see [[Personas]])
- Journey map (current experience, pain points) (see [[Journey-Maps]])

**2. Competitive Analysis:**
What solutions exist? What works? What doesn't?

**Process:**

- Identify 3-5 competitors (direct or indirect)
- Analyze: Features, UX, visual design, strengths, weaknesses
- Take screenshots, annotate

**Deliverables:**

- Competitive analysis matrix (features comparison)
- Key insights (what can you learn? what gaps exist?)

**3. Define Problem:**
Synthesize research into clear problem statement.

**Example:**
"College students need a simple way to track spending and visualize budget progress because current tools are complex, time-consuming, and designed for older adults with different financial needs."

**Deliverables:**

- Refined problem statement
- Opportunity areas (where can design make impact?)

**Time Allocation:**
1-2 weeks (20-30% of total project time)

### Phase 2: Information Architecture

**Goal:** Organize information and define structure.

**Activities:**

**1. Sitemap:**
What screens/pages exist? How are they organized?

**Example:**

```
App
├── Onboarding
│   ├── Welcome
│   ├── Set Budget
│   └── Connect Account (optional)
├── Dashboard
│   ├── Overview (spending this month)
│   ├── Add Expense (quick action)
│   └── View by Category
├── Expenses
│   ├── All Expenses (list)
│   ├── Expense Detail
│   └── Edit/Delete
├── Goals
│   ├── Set Goal
│   ├── Track Progress
│   └── Celebrate Milestones
└── Settings
    ├── Profile
    ├── Categories
    └── Notifications
```

See [[Sitemaps]], [[Information-Architecture]]

**2. User Flows:**
How do users move through the product to complete key tasks?

**Key Flows:**

- Primary: Most important (e.g., "Add expense")
- Secondary: Supporting (e.g., "Edit expense")

**Example Flow: Add Expense**

1. User taps "+" button (Dashboard)
2. Enter amount
3. Select category
4. Add note (optional)
5. Tap "Save"
6. Confirmation (expense saved)
7. Return to Dashboard (updated totals)

**Visual Format:**
Flowchart (rectangles = screens, diamonds = decisions, arrows = transitions)

See [[User-Flows]]

**3. Card Sorting (Optional):**
If complex IA, test with users.

See [[Card-Sorting]]

**Deliverables:**

- Sitemap
- 2-3 key user flows

**Time Allocation:**
1 week (10-15% of total project time)

### Phase 3: Wireframing and Ideation

**Goal:** Explore solutions, establish layout and functionality.

**Activities:**

**1. Sketching:**
Low-fidelity, rapid exploration.

**Process:**

- Sketch 3-5 variations of each key screen (different layouts, approaches)
- Don't focus on details (just boxes, lines, annotations)
- Goal: Explore many ideas quickly

**2. Wireframes:**
Digital, mid-fidelity representation.

**Tools:**
Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, or even paper (photographed).

**What to Include:**

- Layout (where elements go)
- Hierarchy (what's most important?)
- Content (rough copy, placeholder text)
- Functionality (buttons, inputs, navigation)

**What to Exclude:**

- Visual design (colors, typography, imagery)
- Polish (focus on structure, not beauty)

**Screens to Wireframe:**
All key screens (6-10 typical).

**Example:**

- Onboarding (2 screens)
- Dashboard
- Add Expense
- Expense List
- Expense Detail
- Budget Goal
- Settings

See [[Wireframing]]

**3. Annotations:**
Explain interactions, logic, states.

**Example:**
"When user taps '+', modal opens for adding expense"
"If no expenses, show empty state: 'No expenses yet. Tap + to add.'"

**4. Usability Testing (Optional but Recommended):**
Test wireframes with 3-5 users.

**Process:**

- Create clickable prototype (Figma)
- Give users tasks ("Add a $20 expense for coffee")
- Observe: Can they complete? Where do they struggle?
- Iterate based on feedback

See [[Usability-Testing]]

**Deliverables:**

- Sketches (photographs or scans)
- Digital wireframes (8-12 screens)
- Clickable wireframe prototype
- Usability test findings (if conducted)

**Time Allocation:**
1-2 weeks (20-25% of total project time)

### Phase 4: High-Fidelity Design

**Goal:** Apply visual design, create polished interface.

**Activities:**

**1. Visual Design:**
Apply color, typography, imagery, spacing.

**Start With:**

- **Color palette:** Primary, secondary, neutrals, semantic (success, error) (see [[Color-Theory]], [[Design-Tokens]])
- **Typography:** Font family, sizes, weights (see [[Typography]], [[Type-Hierarchy]])
- **Spacing:** Consistent scale (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, etc.) (see [[Design-Tokens]])
- **Iconography:** Icon set (consistent style)

**Design Key Screens:**
Convert wireframes to high-fidelity (8-12 screens typical).

**Consistency:**
Use components (buttons, inputs, cards) to maintain consistency across screens.

See [[Mockups]], [[Figma-Basics]], [[Components-and-Variants]]

**2. Design System (Lightweight):**
You don't need a full design system, but document key components.

**Create:**

- **Foundations:** Color styles, text styles (Figma)
- **Components:** Button, input, card, navigation (with variants)
- **Patterns:** Common UI patterns (form layout, list item)

**Document:**
For each component, note:

- Variants (primary, secondary, sizes)
- States (default, hover, active, disabled)
- Usage guidelines (when to use)

See [[Design-Systems]], [[Component-Libraries]], [[Design-Tokens]]

**Why This Matters:**

- Consistency across designs
- Easier to iterate (change button style once, updates everywhere)
- Portfolio piece (shows systems thinking)

**3. Accessibility:**
Ensure designs meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA.

**Check:**

- Color contrast (4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI components)
- Touch targets (48x48px minimum)
- Focus indicators (visible outline)
- Text size (16px minimum for body)

See [[Accessibility]], [[WCAG-Guidelines]], [[Contrast-and-Accessibility]]

**4. Responsive Design (if applicable):**
If web or cross-device, design for mobile and desktop.

See [[Responsive-Design]]

**Deliverables:**

- High-fidelity designs (8-12 screens)
- Design system components (documented)
- Style guide (colors, typography, spacing)

**Time Allocation:**
2-3 weeks (30-35% of total project time)

### Phase 5: Prototyping

**Goal:** Make designs interactive, simulate real product.

**Activities:**

**1. Interactive Prototype:**
Connect screens with interactions.

**Tools:**
Figma (Prototype mode), Adobe XD, Principle, ProtoPie, Framer.

**Interactions to Include:**

- Navigation (tap button → go to screen)
- Forms (tap input → keyboard appears)
- States (tap like → icon fills)
- Animations (page transitions, micro-interactions)

**Flows to Prototype:**
Primary user flows (e.g., "Add expense," "Set budget goal")

See [[Figma-Prototyping]], [[Hi-Fi-Prototyping]], [[Micro-Interactions]]

**2. Micro-Interactions:**
Add delight and feedback.

**Examples:**

- Button press (slight scale down)
- Success (checkmark animation)
- Loading (spinner)

See [[Micro-Interactions]], [[Animation-Principles]]

**3. Usability Testing:**
Test prototype with 5-8 users.

**Process:**

- Give tasks ("Add a $15 expense for lunch")
- Observe: Can they complete? What's confusing?
- Iterate based on feedback

**Document:**

- Test plan (tasks, questions)
- Findings (issues discovered, quotes)
- Changes made (before/after)

See [[Usability-Testing]], [[Testing-Methods]]

**Deliverables:**

- Interactive prototype (shareable link)
- Usability test report (findings, iterations)

**Time Allocation:**
1 week (10-15% of total project time)

### Phase 6: Case Study

**Goal:** Document process, decisions, outcomes.

**Purpose:**

- Tell story (problem → solution)
- Showcase thinking (not just final designs)

**2. Problem / Challenge:**

- What's the problem?
- Why does it matter?
- Who's affected?

**Example:**
"College students struggle to track spending and budget effectively. Existing tools are complex, time-consuming, and not designed for limited budgets or mobile-first usage. This leads to overspending and financial stress during a critical life stage."

**3. Research:**

- Methods (interviews, surveys, competitive analysis)
- Key insights (user needs, pain points)
- Personas (1-2)

- Success metrics (how you'll measure)

**5. Information Architecture:**

- Sitemap
- User flows (2-3 key flows)

**6. Ideation / Wireframes:**

- Sketches (show exploration)
- Wireframes (key screens)
- Explain decisions (why this layout?)

**7. Visual Design:**

- High-fidelity designs (key screens, multiple shown)
- Design system (color palette, typography, components)
- Explain decisions (why these colors? this font? this layout?)

**8. Prototyping / Testing:**

- Link to prototype (or embed video)
- Usability test findings
- Iterations (before/after based on feedback)

**9. Outcome / Impact:**

- What was delivered?
- Success metrics (if measurable)
- What would you improve? (honest reflection)
- Next steps (if it were to continue)

**Example:**
"Delivered an interactive prototype of 8 key screens with a lightweight design system. In usability testing, 8/8 users successfully added an expense in under 10 seconds (meeting our goal). Next steps would include developing the app and testing with a larger, more diverse user group."

**10. Learnings / Reflection:**

- What did you learn?
- What would you do differently?
- What are you most proud of?

**Presentation:**

**Format:**

- Web page (portfolio site)
- PDF (for sharing)
- Presentation deck (for presenting)

**Tools:**

- **Portfolio platforms:** Behance, Dribbble, personal website
- **Presentation tools:** Figma (slides), PowerPoint, Keynote

**Length:**

- Web/PDF: 5-10 "sections" (scrollable)
- Presentation: 15-25 slides

- Presentation (if presenting to stakeholders or class)

**Time Allocation:**
1-2 weeks (15-20% of total project time)

### Presenting Your Capstone

**If presenting to stakeholders, class, or portfolio reviewers:**

**Structure:**

1. **Intro:** Who you are, project title (1 minute)
2. **Problem:** What problem? Why important? (2 minutes)
3. **Research:** Key insights, personas (3 minutes)
4. **Solution:** Walkthrough of designs, prototype demo (5 minutes)
5. **Outcome:** Metrics, learnings, next steps (2 minutes)
6. **Q&A:** Questions (3-5 minutes)

**Total:** 15-20 minutes

**Tips:**

- **Tell story:** Problem → solution (not just "here's my design")
- **Show, don't just tell:** Visuals, prototype demo
- **Explain decisions:** Why did you design it this way?
- **Be honest:** Acknowledge challenges, what you'd improve
- **Practice:** Rehearse multiple times
- **Backup plan:** If live demo fails, have video or screenshots

**Handling Questions:**

- **"Why did you choose X?"** → Explain rationale (user needs, research insights, design principles)
- **"What would you do differently?"** → Honest reflection (more testing, more time on X, etc.)
- **"How did you validate this?"** → Usability testing results, feedback, metrics

See [[Feedback-and-Critique]]

### Project Management Tips

**Stay Organized:**

**1. Timeline:**
Break project into phases, set deadlines.

**Example:**

- Week 1: Research
- Week 2: IA and wireframes
- Week 3: Wireframe testing, iterate
- Week 4-5: High-fidelity design
- Week 6: Prototyping and testing
- Week 7: Iterate based on testing
- Week 8: Case study

**2. Task List:**
List all tasks, check off as completed.

**Tools:**

- Notion, Trello, Asana, or simple to-do list

**3. Version Control:**
Save versions (Figma version history, file naming: "v1", "v2", "final")

**Avoid Scope Creep:**

**Signs of Scope Creep:**

- Adding features mid-project ("It would be cool if...")
- Expanding target users ("Let's also design for seniors")
- Redesigning everything (never satisfied)

**How to Avoid:**

- **Refer to project brief:** Is this in scope? If not, save for "Phase 2" (post-capstone)
- **Set constraints:** Max 10 screens, 2 primary flows
- **Timebox:** If you've spent 2 weeks on wireframes, move on (even if not perfect)

**Seek Feedback:**

**When:**

- After research (validate insights)
- After wireframes (before investing in high-fi)
- After first high-fi designs (catch issues early)
- After prototype (usability test)

**Who:**

- Mentors, peers, designers, target users

**How:**

- Share link (Figma, prototype)
- Specific questions ("Is the navigation clear?" not "What do you think?")
- Take notes, don't defend (listen, thank, consider)

See [[Feedback-and-Critique]]

**Avoid Perfectionism:**
Done is better than perfect. You can always iterate later.

**Signs You're Over-Polishing:**

- Tweaking colors endlessly (pick one, move on)
- Redoing layouts repeatedly (test with users instead)
- Spending hours on single screen (timebox, move forward)

**Mindset:**
This is a learning project. It doesn't have to be flawless. Focus on demonstrating process and thinking.

### Common Capstone Pitfalls

**1. Skipping Research:**
Starting with designs without understanding users.

- **Fix:** Always start with research. Talk to real people.

**2. Scope Too Large:**
Trying to design everything.

- **Fix:** Focus on 1-3 key flows, 8-12 screens. Cut ruthlessly.

**3. Weak Problem Statement:**
Vague or made-up problem.

- **Fix:** Ground in real user need (validated through research).

**4. Focusing Only on Visuals:**
Beautiful designs, no UX thinking.

- **Fix:** Show research, wireframes, testing. Tell story of decisions.

**5. No User Testing:**
Assuming designs work without validation.

- **Fix:** Test with 5+ users, iterate based on feedback.

**6. Poor Case Study:**
Only showing final designs, not process.

- **Fix:** Document everything. Show messy sketches, research notes, iterations.

**7. Ignoring Accessibility:**
Designs that don't meet accessibility standards.

- **Fix:** Check contrast, touch targets, focus states. Use tools (Figma plugins).

**8. Rushing Final Phase:**
No time for case study, poor presentation.

- **Fix:** Budget 1-2 weeks for case study. It's as important as designs.

**9. Not Seeking Feedback:**
Working in isolation.

- **Fix:** Share work regularly with mentors, peers, users.

**10. Over-Complicating:**
Too many features, too complex.

- **Fix:** Simplify. What's the core experience? Start there.

## Practice Exercises

Since this is the capstone, the "exercise" is the full project. However, here are preparatory exercises:

1. **Project Brief Practice:** Write 3 project briefs for potential capstone ideas:

   - Problem statement
   - Target users
   - Goals
   - Scope (in/out)
   - Success metrics
     Review with mentor/peer, get feedback on clarity and feasibility.

2. **Research Practice:** Choose one project brief. Conduct mini research:

   - Interview 3 people (target users or close proxies)
   - Synthesize: Key insights, pain points
   - Create 1 persona
     This validates whether problem is real and interesting.

3. **IA Practice:** For your chosen project:

   - Create sitemap (all screens/sections)
   - Map 2 key user flows (flowchart format)
     This tests whether scope is manageable.

4. **Timeline Planning:** Create detailed timeline for your capstone:

   - Break into phases (research, IA, wireframes, design, prototype, case study)
   - Assign weeks to each phase
   - List key deliverables for each phase
   - Identify potential risks (e.g., "Hard to recruit users")
     Share with mentor, adjust based on feedback.

5. **Case Study Analysis:** Find 3 strong UX case studies on Behance or Dribbble:

   - What makes them compelling?
   - What structure do they follow?
   - What visuals do they include?
   - What would you do differently?
     Write 1-page analysis. Use insights to plan your own case study.

6. **Feedback Session:** Share early work (wireframes, initial designs) with 3 designers or peers:
