# Wireframing

## Introduction

Wireframing is the practice of creating low-fidelity, structural blueprints of interfaces that focus on layout, hierarchy, and functionality without the distraction of visual design. Wireframes are the architectural drawings of digital products—defining what goes where, how elements relate, and how users will navigate—before investing time in high-fidelity design. They're essential for rapid iteration, stakeholder alignment, and testing information architecture decisions early.

The power of wireframing lies in its constraints. By deliberately removing color, imagery, and typography details, wireframes force focus on structure, content priority, and user flow. This makes them faster to create, easier to change, and less emotionally attached to—enabling honest critique and rapid experimentation. Wireframes answer "Does this structure work?" before asking "Does this look good?"

In professional practice, wireframes bridge the gap between [[Information-Architecture]] and [[Hi-Fi-Prototyping]]. They translate research insights and user flows into concrete screen layouts, enabling early usability testing and alignment across product, design, and engineering teams.

## Learning Objectives

By mastering Wireframing, you will be able to:

- Create [[Low-Fidelity Wireframes]] that focus on structure over aesthetics
- Use [[Wireframe Fidelity Levels]] (sketches, low-fi, mid-fi) appropriately
- Apply [[Wireframe Notation]] (annotations, interaction notes, content guidelines)
- Translate [[User-Flows]] and [[Sitemaps]] into screen-level wireframes
- Conduct early [[Usability-Testing]] with wireframe prototypes
- Choose appropriate [[Wireframe Tools]] and methods for different contexts
- Progress from wireframes to [[Mockups]] systematically

## Key Knowledge Points

### Wireframe Fundamentals

- [[Wireframes]]

  - Low-fidelity visual representations
  - Focus on:
    - Layout and structure
    - Content hierarchy
    - Navigation patterns
    - Functionality and interactions
  - Deliberately exclude:
    - Final colors (use grays)
    - Real images (use placeholders)
    - Final typography (use system fonts)
    - Detailed visual polish

- **Purpose of Wireframes:**
  - [[Rapid Iteration]] (fast to create and change)
  - [[Early Testing]] (validate structure before visual design)
  - [[Stakeholder Communication]] (focus on functionality, not aesthetics)
  - [[Development Planning]] (engineers understand requirements)
  - [[Content Planning]] (determine content needs)

### Fidelity Levels

- [[Low-Fidelity Wireframes]] (Lo-Fi)

  - Rough, sketch-like
  - Boxes and placeholders
  - Gray scale only
  - No interaction details
  - Use for: Early exploration, brainstorming
  - Tools: Paper, whiteboard, Figma rectangles

- [[Mid-Fidelity Wireframes]] (Mid-Fi)

  - More refined structure
  - Actual content hierarchy
  - Basic interaction notes
  - Still grayscale
  - Use for: Client presentations, usability testing
  - Tools: Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD

- [[High-Fidelity Wireframes]]

  - Detailed layout
  - Real content (or close)
  - Interaction specifications
  - May include basic styling
  - Blurs line with [[Mockups]]
  - Use for: Final documentation, development handoff

- [[Paper Sketches]]
  - Fastest wireframing method
  - Pencil/pen on paper
  - Perfect for early ideation
  - Easy to throw away (reduces attachment)

### Wireframe Elements

- [[Content Placeholders]]

  - Gray boxes for images
  - Lines or Lorem Ipsum for text
  - Icons as simple shapes
  - Keep it generic

- [[Navigation Elements]]

  - Header/menu structure
  - Breadcrumbs
  - Tabs
  - Pagination
  - Footer links

- [[UI Components]] (simplified)

  - Buttons (labeled rectangles)
  - Input fields (boxes with labels)
  - Dropdowns (box with arrow)
  - Checkboxes, radio buttons
  - Cards (outlined containers)

- [[Annotations]]
  - Notes explaining functionality
  - Interaction descriptions
  - Content guidelines
  - Conditional logic
  - Numbered callouts

### Wireframing Process

1. **Gather Requirements**

   - Review [[User-Flows]]
   - Study [[Information-Architecture]]
   - Understand [[User Stories]]
   - List required content and functionality

2. **Sketch Multiple Options**

   - Diverge: Create 3-5 different layouts
   - Don't commit too early
   - Explore different approaches
   - Paper or digital sketching

3. **Evaluate & Select**

   - Compare against requirements
   - Consider [[Usability Heuristics]]
   - Get team input
   - Choose strongest direction

4. **Refine**

   - Add detail to selected direction
   - Ensure all content has a place
   - Specify interactions
   - Add annotations

5. **Test**
   - [[Paper Prototyping]] or digital clickthrough
   - [[Usability-Testing]] with 3-5 users
   - Observe pain points
   - Iterate based on findings

### Wireframe Patterns

- [[Common Wireframe Patterns]]

  - [[Hero Section]] (large header with CTA)
  - [[Three-Column Layout]]
  - [[Card Grid]]
  - [[List View]]
  - [[Detail View]]
  - [[Form Layout]]
  - [[Dashboard Layout]]
  - [[Sidebar Navigation]]
  - [[Modal Overlay]]

- **Mobile Wireframe Patterns:**
  - [[Tab Bar]] (bottom navigation)
  - [[Hamburger Menu]]
  - [[Vertical Scroll]] (primary navigation)
  - [[Swipeable Cards]]
  - [[Bottom Sheet]]

### Best Practices

- **Keep It Simple**

  - Resist urge to add visual design
  - Stick to grayscale
  - Use basic shapes
  - Focus on structure

- **Label Everything**

  - Component names
  - Interaction notes
  - Content placeholders
  - Edge cases

- **Show Context**

  - Include header/footer
  - Show navigation state
  - Indicate scroll areas
  - Mark modals/overlays

- **Version Control**

  - Date wireframes
  - Number iterations
  - Document changes
  - Keep old versions for reference

- **Collaborate**
  - Share early and often
  - Get feedback from stakeholders
  - Involve developers
  - Test with users
