# Typography

## Introduction

Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and visually appealing. In digital design, typography is responsible for communicating 95% of information and is the primary vehicle for establishing hierarchy, tone, and brand personality. Poor typography confuses users and undermines credibility; excellent typography is invisible yet indispensable.

Mastering typography means understanding not just font selection, but the nuanced relationships between [[Type Scale]], [[Line Height]], [[Letter Spacing]], [[Font Weight]], and [[Font Pairing]]. It requires balancing aesthetic expression with functional readability, ensuring text performs well across devices, screen sizes, and reading contexts.

Typography is a system, not a collection of fonts. Professional designers build [[Type Systems]] with consistent scales, clear hierarchies, and semantic meaning. This systematic approach ensures maintainability in [[Design Systems]], accessibility for all users, and flexibility for evolving content needs.

## Learning Objectives

By mastering Typography, you will be able to:

- Understand fundamental type anatomy ([[Baseline]], [[X-Height]], [[Cap Height]], [[Ascender]], [[Descender]])
- Select and combine fonts using [[Font Pairing]] principles
- Build a systematic [[Type Scale]] using ratios (1.125, 1.25, 1.333, 1.5, etc.)
- Apply [[Line Height]], [[Letter Spacing]], and [[Paragraph Spacing]] for optimal readability
- Establish clear [[Type Hierarchy]] for scanning and comprehension
- Choose appropriate [[Font Families]] for digital interfaces (sans-serif, serif, monospace)
- Ensure typographic [[Accessibility]] (minimum sizes, contrast, WCAG compliance)

## Key Knowledge Points

### Type Anatomy

- [[Baseline]]
- [[X-Height]]
- [[Cap Height]]
- [[Ascender]]
- [[Descender]]
- [[Counter]] (enclosed/partially enclosed space)
- [[Bowl]]
- [[Stem]]
- [[Serif]]
- [[Sans-Serif]]
- [[Stroke Weight]]
- [[Aperture]]

### Font Classifications

- [[Font Family]]
  - [[Sans-Serif Fonts]] (modern, clean, digital-friendly)
  - [[Serif Fonts]] (traditional, readable for long-form)
  - [[Monospace Fonts]] (code, technical content)
  - [[Display Fonts]] (headlines, decorative)
  - [[Script Fonts]] (handwriting styles)
- [[Typeface]] vs [[Font]]
- [[Font Weight]]
  - Thin (100), Light (300), Regular (400), Medium (500), Semibold (600), Bold (700), Black (900)
- [[Font Style]]
  - Regular, Italic, Oblique
- [[Variable Fonts]]

### Type System Design

- [[Type Scale]]
  - Modular scale ratios (Major Second 1.125, Minor Third 1.2, Major Third 1.25, Perfect Fourth 1.333, Golden Ratio 1.618)
  - [[Typographic Scale Calculator]]
- [[Type Hierarchy]]
  - H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6
  - Body text, Caption, Overline
  - Size, weight, color for hierarchy
- [[Line Height]] (Leading)
  - Body text: 1.5-1.6 typical
  - Headlines: 1.1-1.3 typical
  - Relationship to line length
- [[Letter Spacing]] (Tracking)
  - Tighter for large text
  - Looser for small text, uppercase, or low contrast
- [[Word Spacing]]
- [[Paragraph Spacing]]
- [[Line Length]] (Measure)
  - Optimal: 45-75 characters per line
  - 66 characters often cited as ideal

### Font Selection & Pairing

- [[Font Pairing]]
  - Contrast principle (combine different classifications)
  - Serif + Sans-Serif
  - Display + Body
  - [[Superfamily Fonts]] (pre-designed pairs)
- [[Google Fonts]]
- [[Adobe Fonts]]
- [[Font Licensing]]
- [[Web Fonts]]
- [[System Fonts]] (native font stacks)

### Readability & Accessibility

- [[Readability]]
  - Font size (minimum 16px for body text on web)
  - Contrast (see [[Contrast-and-Accessibility]])
  - Line length, line height balance
- [[Legibility]]
- [[Font Size]]
  - Mobile minimum: 16px (prevents zoom)
  - Accessible minimum: 14-16px body text
  - [[Large Text]] (18pt+) vs [[Small Text]]
- [[Responsive Typography]]
  - [[Fluid Typography]]
  - [[Viewport Units]] (vw, vh)

### Advanced Typography

- [[Kerning]] (adjusting space between specific letter pairs)
- [[Ligatures]]
- [[Orphans and Widows]]
- [[Hanging Punctuation]]
- [[Hyphenation]]
- [[Text Alignment]]
  - Left-aligned (standard for LTR languages)
  - Right-aligned
  - Center-aligned (use sparingly)
  - Justified (requires careful hyphenation)
- [[All Caps]] (use with increased letter spacing)
- [[Sentence Case]] vs [[Title Case]]

## Practice Exercises

1. **Type Scale Building:** Create 3 type scales using different ratios (1.2, 1.333, 1.5). Apply to a sample article layout.
2. **Font Pairing:** Pair 5 different font combinations for different brand personalities (playful, corporate, elegant, technical, friendly)
3. **Anatomy Study:** Analyze 3 fonts and annotate x-height, aperture, stroke weight, and other characteristics
4. **Readability Testing:** Set the same long-form article in 5 different typographic treatments. Test with users. Measure reading time and comprehension.
5. **Responsive Type:** Build a type system that scales fluidly from mobile (320px) to desktop (1920px)
