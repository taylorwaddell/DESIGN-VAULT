# Layout and Composition

## Introduction

Layout and composition are the structural foundations of visual design, determining how elements are arranged in space to create meaning, hierarchy, and flow. While color and typography capture attention, layout organizes it—guiding the eye, establishing relationships, and creating the visual logic that makes interfaces intuitive. Poor layout results in confusion and cognitive overload; masterful layout feels effortless and inevitable.

Effective composition balances order and flexibility, structure and creativity. It employs [[Grid Systems]], [[Alignment]], [[Proximity]], [[White Space]], and [[Visual Weight]] to create organized, scannable, and aesthetically pleasing interfaces. These principles aren't arbitrary aesthetic preferences—they're rooted in [[Gestalt Principles]] and human visual perception, making them psychologically powerful and universally applicable.

In modern UI/UX design, composition must be responsive, accessible, and systematic. Layouts built on [[8-Point Grid]] systems and [[Auto-Layout]] principles scale gracefully across devices, maintain consistency in [[Design Systems]], and adapt to dynamic content without breaking.

## Learning Objectives

By mastering Layout and Composition, you will be able to:

- Apply fundamental composition principles ([[Balance]], [[Alignment]], [[Proximity]], [[Contrast]], [[Repetition]])
- Use [[Grid Systems]] (column grids, modular grids, baseline grids) to create structure
- Leverage [[White Space]] strategically to improve readability and focus
- Create [[Visual Hierarchy]] through spatial relationships and [[Visual Weight]]
- Apply [[Gestalt Principles]] to create intuitive groupings and relationships
- Design responsive layouts that adapt across [[Breakpoints]]
- Use [[8-Point Grid]] systems for consistent spacing and alignment

## Key Knowledge Points

### Composition Fundamentals

- [[Visual Weight]]
  - Size, color, contrast, position affect perceived importance
  - [[Focal Point]] creation
- [[Balance]]
  - [[Symmetrical Balance]] (formal, stable)
  - [[Asymmetrical Balance]] (dynamic, modern)
  - [[Radial Balance]]
- [[Alignment]]
  - Edge alignment
  - Center alignment
  - Baseline alignment
  - Creates invisible connections between elements
- [[Proximity]]
  - Related items close together
  - Unrelated items separated
  - Reduces cognitive load
- [[Repetition]]
  - Visual consistency
  - Pattern recognition
  - [[Rhythm]]
- [[Contrast]]
  - Size, color, shape, direction
  - Creates hierarchy and interest
- [[Movement]] (guiding the eye path)
- [[Unity]] (cohesive wholeness)

### Grid Systems

- [[Grid Systems]]
  - [[Column Grid]]
    - Common: 12-column (web), 8-column (tablet), 4-column (mobile)
    - [[Gutter]] spacing between columns
    - [[Margin]] spacing from edges
  - [[Modular Grid]]
    - Columns + rows creating modules
    - Complex layouts (dashboards, newspapers)
  - [[Baseline Grid]]
    - Vertical rhythm alignment
    - Typ ically 4px or 8px increments
  - [[Manuscript Grid]] (single column, books/articles)
- [[8-Point Grid]]
  - All spacing in multiples of 8 (8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64px)
  - Exceptions: 4px for fine adjustments, icons
  - Simplifies spacing decisions, improves consistency
- [[12-Column Grid]]
- [[Breakpoints]]
  - Mobile: 320-767px
  - Tablet: 768-1023px
  - Desktop: 1024px+
  - Common breakpoints: 320, 768, 1024, 1440, 1920

### White Space

- [[White Space]] (Negative Space)
  - [[Micro White Space]] (between lines, letters, UI elements)
  - [[Macro White Space]] (margins, padding, section separation)
  - [[Active White Space]] (intentional, structural)
  - [[Passive White Space]] (inherent, unavoidable)
- [[Breathing Room]]
- [[Gutters]]
- [[Margins]]
- [[Padding]]

### Layout Patterns

- [[F-Pattern]] (common eye-tracking pattern for text-heavy content)
- [[Z-Pattern]] (for simple layouts, landing pages)
- [[Gutenberg Diagram]] (reading gravity: top-left to bottom-right)
- [[Golden Ratio]] (1.618:1) in layout proportions
- [[Rule of Thirds]]
- [[Center Alignment]]
- [[Asymmetric Layout]]
- [[Card Layout]]
- [[Split-Screen Layout]]
- [[Full-Width Layout]]
- [[Boxed Layout]]

### Responsive Composition

- [[Responsive Design]]
- [[Fluid Grids]]
- [[Flexible Images]]
- [[Mobile-First Design]]
- [[Desktop-First Design]]
- [[Responsive Typography]]
- [[Stack Layout]] (mobile: vertical; desktop: horizontal)

## Practice Exercises

1. **Grid Recreation:** Choose 3 well-designed websites and reverse-engineer their grid systems (columns, gutters, margins)
2. **Grid Exploration:** Design the same 3-section page using 4-column, 8-column, and 12-column grids. Compare flexibility.
3. **White Space Study:** Take a cramped design and add strategic white space. Measure improvement in clarity and scannability.
4. **8-Point Conversion:** Take an existing design and convert all spacing to 8-point increments. Document consistency improvements.
5. **Responsive Layout:** Design a dashboard that works on mobile (375px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1440px) using a consistent grid system.
