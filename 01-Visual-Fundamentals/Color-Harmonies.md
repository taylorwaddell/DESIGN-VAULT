# Color Harmonies

## Introduction

Color harmonies are proven combinations of colors derived from mathematical relationships on the [[Color Wheel]] that create visually pleasing and balanced compositions. These systematic approaches to color selection remove guesswork and provide designers with reliable frameworks for building cohesive color palettes. Understanding color harmonies is essential for creating designs that feel intentional, balanced, and professionally crafted.

Each harmony type serves different aesthetic and functional purposes. [[Complementary Colors]] create high contrast and energy, [[Analogous Colors]] provide subtle sophistication, [[Triadic Colors]] offer vibrant balance, and [[Monochromatic Colors]] deliver elegant simplicity. By mastering these relationships, designers can rapidly generate multiple palette options and select the most appropriate harmony for their project's goals.

In professional practice, color harmonies form the foundation of [[Design Systems]] and [[Style-Guides]], ensuring consistency across products and platforms. They bridge artistic intuition and systematic design thinking, enabling both creative exploration and rational decision-making.

## Learning Objectives

By mastering Color Harmonies, you will be able to:

- Identify and create [[Complementary Colors]] schemes for high-contrast, energetic designs
- Build [[Analogous Colors]] palettes for harmonious, cohesive interfaces
- Apply [[Triadic Colors]] schemes for vibrant, balanced compositions
- Construct [[Tetradic Colors]] (double complementary) palettes for complex, rich designs
- Create [[Monochromatic Colors]] schemes using variations of a single hue
- Select appropriate harmony types based on project goals and brand personality
- Combine harmonies with [[Color Theory]] principles to create custom, sophisticated palettes

## Key Knowledge Points

### Core Harmony Types

- [[Complementary Colors]]

  - Colors directly opposite on the [[Color Wheel]]
  - High contrast and visual tension
  - Use cases: CTAs, attention-grabbing elements
  - Example: Blue and Orange, Red and Green

- [[Split-Complementary Colors]]

  - Base color + two colors adjacent to its complement
  - Softer than complementary while maintaining contrast
  - More versatile and easier to balance

- [[Analogous Colors]]

  - 3-5 colors adjacent on the [[Color Wheel]]
  - Harmonious, serene, comfortable
  - Use cases: Background gradients, subtle UI themes
  - Example: Blue, Blue-Green, Green

- [[Triadic Colors]]

  - Three colors evenly spaced on the [[Color Wheel]] (120° apart)
  - Vibrant, balanced, dynamic
  - Use cases: Playful brands, diverse content categories
  - Example: Red, Yellow, Blue

- [[Tetradic Colors]] (Double Complementary)

  - Two complementary color pairs
  - Rich, complex, demanding balance
  - Use cases: Complex dashboards, data visualization

- [[Monochromatic Colors]]
  - Variations of a single [[Hue]] using different [[Saturation]] and [[Value]]
  - Creates [[Tint]], [[Shade]], and [[Tone]] variations
  - Elegant, cohesive, sophisticated
  - Use cases: Minimalist designs, photography portfolios

### Advanced Harmony Concepts

- [[Square Harmony]]

  - Four colors evenly spaced on the [[Color Wheel]] (90° apart)
  - Similar to tetradic but more balanced

- [[Custom Harmonies]]
- [[60-30-10 Rule]] (dominant, secondary, accent color ratios)
- [[Color Hierarchy]]
- [[Neutral Colors]] in harmonies
- [[Achromatic Colors]] (black, white, grays)

## Practice Exercises

1. **Harmony Exploration:** Create 5 different palettes for the same app concept using each major harmony type
2. **Reverse Engineering:** Analyze 10 well-designed websites and identify which harmony types they use
3. **Harmony Switching:** Take one design and swap its harmony type—observe how it changes the mood
4. **Brand Harmony:** Choose 5 brands and identify their primary color harmony and why it fits their personality
5. **Custom Palette:** Build a unique palette that intentionally breaks harmony rules but still works—document why
