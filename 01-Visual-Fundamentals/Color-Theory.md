# Color Theory

## Introduction

Color theory is the foundation of visual design, providing a scientific and artistic framework for understanding how colors interact, harmonize, and communicate meaning. It encompasses the psychological, cultural, and technical aspects of color usage in design. Mastering color theory enables designers to create intentional color palettes that enhance usability, evoke specific emotions, and establish visual hierarchy.

Understanding the [[Color Wheel]], [[Color Harmonies]], and color relationships is essential for making confident design decisions. Color theory bridges the gap between subjective aesthetic choices and objective design principles, allowing designers to explain and defend their color selections with clarity and purpose.

In UI/UX design, color theory directly impacts [[Accessibility]], [[Visual Hierarchy]], and [[Brand Identity]]. A solid grasp of color fundamentals ensures your designs are both beautiful and functional, meeting accessibility standards while creating memorable user experiences.

## Learning Objectives

By mastering Color Theory, you will be able to:

- Understand and navigate the [[Color Wheel]] and identify [[Primary Colors]], [[Secondary Colors]], and [[Tertiary Colors]]
- Apply [[Color Harmonies]] (complementary, analogous, triadic, tetradic) to create balanced palettes
- Distinguish between [[Hue]], [[Saturation]], [[Value]], [[Brightness]], and [[Luminance]]
- Understand [[Color Temperature]] and use [[Warm Colors]] and [[Cool Colors]] strategically
- Apply [[Color Psychology]] to evoke specific emotions and user responses
- Create accessible color combinations that meet [[WCAG]] standards for [[Contrast Ratio]]

## Practice Exercises

1. Create 5 different color palettes using each harmony type (complementary, analogous, triadic, split-complementary, tetradic)
2. Analyze 3 favorite apps/websites and identify their color harmonies and psychological intent
3. Take an existing design and create 3 alternate color schemes using different harmonies
4. Test color combinations for accessibility using contrast checkers and document which pass [[WCAG AA]] and [[WCAG AAA]]
