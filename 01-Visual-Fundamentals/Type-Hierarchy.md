# Type Hierarchy

## Introduction

Type hierarchy is the systematic arrangement of text elements to indicate their relative importance, guide reading order, and create clear content structure. Effective hierarchy enables users to scan, navigate, and comprehend information rapidlyâ€”a critical capability in interfaces where attention is scarce and users are goal-oriented. Without clear hierarchy, even well-written content becomes impenetrable walls of text.

Hierarchy is created through strategic manipulation of [[Font Size]], [[Font Weight]], [[Color]], [[Letter Spacing]], [[Line Height]], and spatial relationships. These variables work in concert to establish dominance, subordination, and relationships between text elements. Strong hierarchy doesn't shout; it whispers clearly, using subtle differences to create obvious structure.

In UI/UX design, type hierarchy extends beyond traditional editorial design to include interactive elements, microcopy, labels, and system messages. A robust typographic hierarchy becomes the foundation of [[Design Systems]], ensuring consistency across teams and scalability across products.

## Learning Objectives

By mastering Type Hierarchy, you will be able to:

- Establish clear heading levels (H1-H6) with distinct visual differences
- Use [[Font Size]], [[Font Weight]], and [[Color]] systematically to create hierarchy
- Apply [[Type Scale]] ratios to generate proportional, harmonious hierarchies
- Balance contrast and subtlety for effective but not overwhelming differentiation
- Create semantic and visual hierarchy that align
- Design hierarchies that work across [[Responsive Design]] breakpoints
- Build reusable typographic systems for [[Design Systems]]

## Key Knowledge Points

### Hierarchy Fundamentals

- [[Visual Hierarchy]]
- [[Content Hierarchy]]
- [[Semantic Hierarchy]] (HTML heading structure)
- [[Typographic Contrast]]
- [[Dominance and Subordination]]
- [[Focal Points]]

### Hierarchy Variables

- [[Font Size]]
  - Primary hierarchy tool
  - Follows [[Type Scale]] ratios
  - Exponential vs. linear progression
- [[Font Weight]]
  - Light (300), Regular (400), Medium (500), Semibold (600), Bold (700)
  - Subtle weight changes for same size text
  - Weight + Size combination
- [[Color]]
  - Primary text (highest contrast)
  - Secondary text (reduced contrast)
  - Tertiary/disabled text (minimum contrast)
  - See [[Contrast-and-Accessibility]]
- [[Letter Spacing]] (Tracking)
  - Uppercase labels with increased spacing
  - Overlines and metadata
- [[Line Height]]
  - Tighter for headings (1.1-1.3)
  - Comfortable for body (1.5-1.6)
- [[Case]]
  - Sentence case vs. Title Case
  - ALL CAPS for labels (with tracking)
- [[Alignment]]
- [[Proximity]] (spatial grouping)
- [[Text Decoration]]
  - Underlines for links
  - Strikethrough for deletions

### Standard Hierarchy Levels

- [[H1]] - Page title (largest, boldest, single use)
- [[H2]] - Major section headings
- [[H3]] - Subsection headings
- [[H4]] - Minor headings
- [[H5]], [[H6]] - Rarely needed; consider restructuring content
- [[Body Text]] - Default reading size (16px+)
- [[Caption]] - Small supporting text
- [[Overline]] - Eyebrow/label text (often uppercase)
- [[Blockquote]]
- [[Link Text]]
- [[Button Text]]
- [[Label Text]]
- [[Helper Text]]
- [[Error Text]]

### Hierarchy Systems

- [[Type Scale]] Application
  - Major Third (1.25): Subtle, conservative
  - Perfect Fourth (1.333): Balanced, common
  - Golden Ratio (1.618): Dramatic, editorial
- [[Modular Scale]]
- [[8-Point Grid]] alignment with type sizes
- [[Typographic Rhythm]]
- [[Vertical Rhythm]]

### Practical Applications

- [[Article Hierarchy]] (editorial content)
- [[Marketing Page Hierarchy]] (persuasion-focused)
- [[Dashboard Hierarchy]] (data density)
- [[Form Hierarchy]] (labels, inputs, helper text)
- [[Navigation Hierarchy]]
- [[Card Hierarchy]]
- [[Mobile Hierarchy]] (simplified for small screens)

## Practice Exercises

1. **Hierarchy Analysis:** Analyze 5 articles from different sources (news, blog, documentation, marketing). Identify their hierarchy patterns and document effectiveness.
2. **Scale Comparison:** Create the same content (blog post) using 3 different type scales (1.2, 1.333, 1.618). Compare readability and mood.
3. **Hierarchy Reduction:** Take a design with 6 hierarchy levels and reduce to 4 without losing clarity.
4. **Variables Isolation:** Create hierarchy using ONLY size, then ONLY weight, then ONLY color. Compare effectiveness.
5. **Component Library:** Build a complete typographic hierarchy system in Figma with styles for H1-H6, body, caption, overline, button, label, helper text.
