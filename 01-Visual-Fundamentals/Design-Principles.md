# Design Principles

## Introduction

Design principles are fundamental laws and guidelines that govern effective visual communication. They're not arbitrary rules but distillations of how human perception works, derived from centuries of art, psychology, and design practice. Mastering these principles provides a reliable framework for making design decisions, evaluating work, and articulating choices to stakeholders and teams.

The most widely taught framework is **CRAP** (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity), sometimes reordered as **CARP**. These four principles work in concert to create order, hierarchy, and meaning in visual compositions. They transform random arrangements into intentional communication, helping users understand relationships, navigate interfaces, and absorb information efficiently.

Understanding design principles elevates designers from decorators to problem-solvers. These principles apply universally—whether designing a poster, website, mobile app, or presentation—making them foundational knowledge that compounds throughout your career.

## Learning Objectives

By mastering Design Principles, you will be able to:

- Apply [[Contrast]] to create hierarchy, emphasis, and visual interest
- Use [[Repetition]] to establish consistency, unity, and brand recognition
- Leverage [[Alignment]] to create invisible connections and organized structure
- Apply [[Proximity]] to communicate relationships and reduce cognitive load
- Understand and apply [[Balance]], [[Emphasis]], [[Movement]], [[Rhythm]], [[Unity]]
- Evaluate designs systematically using principle-based critique
- Make confident, defensible design decisions grounded in principles

## Key Knowledge Points

### Core Principles (CRAP/CARP)

- [[Contrast]]

  - **Purpose:** Create hierarchy, draw attention, add visual interest
  - **Methods:** Size, color, weight, shape, texture, type, space
  - **Rule:** Contrast should be obvious, not subtle
  - **Applications:** Headlines vs body, CTAs vs secondary buttons, active vs inactive states
  - Related: [[Visual Hierarchy]], [[Type-Hierarchy]]

- [[Repetition]]

  - **Purpose:** Unity, consistency, strengthen organization, brand recognition
  - **Methods:** Colors, fonts, spacing, shapes, icons, layout patterns
  - **Rule:** Repeat visual elements throughout design
  - **Applications:** [[Style-Guides]], [[Design-Systems]], [[Component-Libraries]]

- [[Alignment]]

  - **Purpose:** Create connections, organize information, clean appearance
  - **Methods:** Edge alignment, center alignment, baseline alignment
  - **Rule:** Nothing should be placed arbitrarily
  - **Applications:** [[Grid-Systems]], [[Layout-and-Composition]]
  - Types:
    - [[Edge Alignment]] (most common)
    - [[Center Alignment]] (use sparingly)
    - [[Baseline Alignment]] (typography)

- [[Proximity]]
  - **Purpose:** Show relationships, group related items, reduce clutter
  - **Methods:** Strategic spacing, [[White-Space]]
  - **Rule:** Related items close, unrelated items separated
  - **Applications:** Form field grouping, navigation menus, content cards
  - Related: [[Gestalt-Principles]] (Law of Proximity)

### Additional Classic Principles

- [[Balance]]

  - **Visual equilibrium** in composition
  - [[Symmetrical Balance]] (formal, stable, traditional)
  - [[Asymmetrical Balance]] (dynamic, modern, interesting)
  - [[Radial Balance]] (circular patterns)
  - [[Visual Weight]] distribution

- [[Emphasis]] (Dominance)

  - **Creating focal points** and areas of interest
  - One dominant element, subordinate supporting elements
  - [[Focal Point]]
  - Methods: size, color, position, isolation, contrast

- [[Movement]]

  - **Guiding the eye** through composition
  - Visual flow and reading order
  - [[Eye Path]]
  - Created by: alignment, repetition, contrast, direction

- [[Rhythm]]

  - **Repetition with variation**
  - Creates pattern and visual tempo
  - Types: regular, flowing, progressive
  - Related: [[Repetition]], [[Spacing]]

- [[Unity]] (Harmony)

  - **Wholeness and cohesion**
  - All parts feel like they belong together
  - Achieved through: repetition, proximity, alignment, consistent style

- [[Variety]]
  - **Strategic differences** that prevent monotony
  - Balance with unity—not too chaotic, not too boring
  - Created through: contrast, asymmetry, unexpected elements

### Specialized Digital Principles

- [[Progressive Disclosure]]

  - Show only necessary information at each step
  - Reduce cognitive load
  - Related: [[Information-Architecture]]

- [[Affordance]]

  - Visual cues that suggest how to interact
  - Buttons look clickable, sliders look draggable
  - Related: [[Usability-Heuristics]]

- [[Consistency]]

  - Similar elements look and behave similarly
  - Internal consistency (within product)
  - External consistency (platform conventions)
  - Related: [[Design-Systems]]

- [[Feedback]]
  - System communicates state and response to user actions
  - Visual, auditory, haptic feedback
  - Related: [[Micro-Interactions]]

## Practice Exercises

1. **CRAP Audit:** Analyze 5 designs (good and bad) and evaluate each on Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity. Document strengths and weaknesses.

2. **Before/After:** Take a poorly designed flyer or slide and redesign it applying CRAP principles explicitly. Document which principle fixes which problem.

3. **Principle Isolation:** Create 4 versions of the same design, each emphasizing one CRAP principle taken to the extreme. Compare results.

4. **Real-World Hunt:** Find 3 examples each of strong Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity in apps, websites, or print. Screenshot and annotate.

5. **Critique Framework:** Use CRAP as a critique framework for peer design review. Give structured feedback based on principles.
