# Case Studies

## Introduction

A case study is the story of how you solved a design problem—from initial research through final solution and impact. While your portfolio showcases polished visuals, case studies reveal your thinking, process, and decision-making abilities. They answer the questions hiring managers and clients actually care about: How do you approach problems? Can you articulate design rationale? Do you validate ideas with users? Can you balance business goals with user needs? A strong case study demonstrates that you're not just someone who makes things pretty—you're a strategic thinker who solves problems methodically.

The challenge of case studies is distilling weeks or months of work into a compelling narrative that's comprehensive yet scannable, detailed yet not overwhelming. You must showcase the messy reality of design (iteration, failures, pivots) while maintaining a professional polish. Great case studies balance showing (visuals, prototypes, data) with telling (context, decisions, lessons). They're honest about constraints and challenges rather than presenting a sanitized "perfect project." Most importantly, they're tailored to your audience—what a startup founder cares about differs from what a UX researcher or product manager wants to see.

Mastering case studies means understanding narrative structure (problem-solution arc), visual communication (mockups, diagrams, annotations), and strategic selection (choosing projects that highlight your strengths). It requires documenting your work continuously (not scrambling to remember months later), taking quality screenshots and photos, and writing clearly about complex processes. Your case studies become your most powerful career tool—more impactful than your resume, more authentic than your LinkedIn, more persuasive than any interview answer about "your process."

## Learning Objectives

By mastering Case Studies, you will be able to:

- Structure compelling design narratives with clear problem-solution arcs
- Document your design process effectively throughout projects
- Select and present projects that showcase your strengths
- Write clear, engaging descriptions of complex design work
- Create effective visuals that support your narrative
- Demonstrate measurable impact and outcomes
- Tailor case studies to different audiences and contexts
- Present design decisions and rationale persuasively

## Key Knowledge Points

### Why Case Studies Matter

**For Hiring:**

- **Portfolios show what:** Pretty pictures, final designs
- **Case studies show how:** Process, thinking, decisions
- **Hiring managers want how:** Can you think through problems? Work with constraints? Iterate based on feedback?

**What Case Studies Prove:**

- ✅ **Problem-solving ability:** You can identify and solve real problems
- ✅ **Process:** You follow a structured approach (research → design → test → iterate)
- ✅ **User focus:** You design for users (not just aesthetics)
- ✅ **Collaboration:** You work with stakeholders, developers, users
- ✅ **Communication:** You can articulate decisions and rationale
- ✅ **Impact:** Your work produces measurable outcomes
- ✅ **Learning:** You reflect on what worked and what didn't

**Without Case Studies:**

- Hiring managers see pretty pictures, don't understand your role or thinking
- "Did they actually do this? Or copy it?"
- "Can they handle ambiguity and constraints?"
- "Will they fit our process?"

**With Strong Case Studies:**

- Clear understanding of your capabilities
- Confidence you can handle similar challenges
- Examples for interview discussions ("Tell me about a time...")

### Case Study vs Portfolio Piece

**Portfolio Piece:**
Just the designs (mockups, screenshots).

**Example:**
3 screenshots of an app.

**What's Missing:**
Why did you design it? What problem did it solve? Who was it for? Did it work?

**Case Study:**
Designs + story + process.

**Example:**

- Problem: Users couldn't find help resources
- Research: Interviewed 10 users, analyzed support tickets
- Solution: Redesigned help center with better search and categories
- Outcome: Support tickets decreased 35%

**Much More Compelling.**

### When to Create Case Studies

**Ideal:**
Document as you work (take screenshots, notes, photos).

**Why:**

- You remember context and decisions
- You have work-in-progress artifacts (sketches, early iterations)
- Less stressful than trying to recreate months later

**When You're Creating Portfolio:**
Select 3-5 best projects, turn into case studies.

**How to Choose:**

**Criteria:**

1. **Strong outcome:** Measurable impact or clear success
2. **Good story:** Interesting problem, clear arc
3. **Shows skills:** Highlights abilities you want to showcase
4. **Diverse:** Different types (mobile app, web, research-heavy, etc.)
5. **Proud of it:** Work you're excited to talk about

**Red Flags (Avoid):**

- ❌ Weak problem (not real or interesting)
- ❌ No process shown (jumped to final designs)
- ❌ No outcome (you don't know if it worked)
- ❌ NDA issues (can't share publicly)
- ❌ Not proud of result

**Quantity:**

- **Portfolio:** 3-5 case studies (quality over quantity)
- **Too few (<3):** Not enough evidence of skills
- **Too many (>6):** Overwhelming, dilutes focus

### Case Study Structure

**Classic Structure:**

**1. Overview/Introduction**

- Project title
- Your role
- Timeline
- Team (if applicable)
- Tools used
- 1-2 sentence summary

**2. Problem/Challenge**

- What problem were you solving?
- Why did it matter?
- Who was affected?
- Business context (if relevant)

**3. Research/Discovery**

- What research did you conduct?
- Key insights/findings
- User needs, pain points
- Personas, journey maps

**4. Design Process**

- Ideation (sketches, exploration)
- Information architecture (sitemaps, user flows)
- Wireframes (lo-fi → mid-fi)
- Visual design (hi-fi mockups)
- Design system (if applicable)

**5. Solution**

- Final designs (key screens)
- Prototype (link or video)
- Key features/innovations
- Design decisions and rationale

**6. Testing/Validation**

- Usability testing
- Feedback received
- Iterations made (before/after)

**7. Outcome/Impact**

- What was delivered?
- Metrics (if available): increased conversions, reduced errors, time saved, etc.
- Qualitative results: user feedback, stakeholder reactions
- Success stories

**8. Reflection/Learnings**

- What did you learn?
- What would you do differently?
- Next steps (if project continued)

**Variations:**

**Shorter Format (if less space):**
Combine sections (Problem + Research, Design Process + Solution).

**Different Order:**
Some designers start with Solution (hook interest), then explain process.

**Multiple Problems:**
If project had several distinct challenges, organize by problem (Problem 1 → Solution 1, Problem 2 → Solution 2).

### Writing the Narrative

**Principles:**

**1. Tell a Story:**
Not just facts—narrative arc.

**Story Arc:**

- **Setup:** Here's the problem and context
- **Conflict:** Here's what made it challenging
- **Resolution:** Here's how I solved it
- **Outcome:** Here's what happened

**Example:**

**Weak (Just Facts):**
"I redesigned the checkout flow. I made wireframes, then high-fidelity designs. Here are the screens."

**Strong (Story):**
"Users were abandoning their carts at alarming rates. Through research, I discovered that the 8-step checkout process was overwhelming and confusing. I streamlined it to 3 steps, tested with users, and reduced abandonment by 25%."

**2. Be Specific:**
Vague = unimpressive.

**Vague:**
"I improved the user experience."

**Specific:**
"I reduced the number of clicks to complete checkout from 12 to 5, resulting in 30% faster completion times."

**3. Show, Don't Just Tell:**
Visuals support narrative.

- ❌ "I created wireframes."
- ✅ "I created wireframes." + [Show wireframes]

**4. Explain Decisions:**
Don't just show designs—explain why.

**Example:**
"I moved the search bar to the top-center because user testing revealed that 80% of users expected to find it there. This small change increased search usage by 40%."

**5. Be Honest:**
Acknowledge challenges, constraints, failures.

**Example:**
"Initially, I designed a complex filtering system, but usability testing revealed it was confusing. I simplified it to 3 primary filters, which tested much better."

Honesty = credibility. Real projects have setbacks.

**6. Focus on Impact:**
What changed because of your work?

**Quantitative:**

- Increased conversions by X%
- Reduced support tickets by X%
- Decreased task time from X to Y
- Increased user satisfaction score from X to Y

**Qualitative:**

- User feedback: "This is so much easier now!"
- Stakeholder reactions: "This exceeded expectations"
- Adoption: "Team adopted design system within 3 months"

**If You Don't Have Metrics:**
Explain why and offer alternatives.

**Example:**
"Due to project timeline, we couldn't measure long-term impact. However, in usability testing, 9 out of 10 users successfully completed the task without assistance, compared to 3 out of 10 with the old design."

**7. Keep It Scannable:**
Readers scan, don't read every word.

**Make Scannable:**

- **Headings:** Clear section titles
- **Bullet points:** Break up long paragraphs
- **Bold key points:** Important insights, metrics
- **Short paragraphs:** 2-4 sentences max
- **Visuals:** Images break up text

**8. Use Active Voice:**
"I designed" (not "The design was created").

Active voice is clearer, more engaging, shows ownership.

**9. Write Conversationally:**
Professional, but not robotic.

**Robotic:**
"An analysis of user feedback was conducted, revealing several pain points in the current system."

**Conversational:**
"I analyzed user feedback and discovered several pain points in the current system."

**10. Vary Sentence Length:**
Short sentences. Long sentences provide detail and context, creating rhythm and maintaining interest. Short punch.

### Visual Presentation

**Types of Visuals:**

**1. Hero Image:**
Eye-catching image at top (mockup of final designs).

**Purpose:** Hook interest, show quality.

**Tips:**

- High resolution (2x for retina displays)
- Show designs in context (phone mockup, laptop mockup, real environment)
- Professional mockup tools: Figma, Mockuuups, Cleanmock

**2. Research Artifacts:**

- Photos of interviews, sticky notes, whiteboard sessions
- Journey maps, personas
- Competitive analysis

**Purpose:** Show rigor, user focus.

**3. Process Visuals:**

- Sketches (show exploration)
- Wireframes (show evolution lo-fi → hi-fi)
- Multiple iterations (show options considered)

**Purpose:** Show thinking, not just final result.

**4. Final Designs:**

- High-fidelity mockups (key screens)
- Multiple screens showing flow
- Annotations (highlight key features, interactions)

**Purpose:** Show craftsmanship, solution.

**5. Prototypes:**

- Embedded videos (walkthrough of prototype)
- GIFs (show micro-interactions)
- Links to live prototypes

**Purpose:** Show interactivity, not just static designs.

**6. Before/After:**

- Side-by-side comparisons
- Show improvement

**Purpose:** Show impact visually.

**Example:**
"Before: Cluttered, confusing navigation | After: Simplified, clear navigation"

**7. Metrics/Data:**

- Charts, graphs (show impact)
- Quotes from users (testimonials)

**Purpose:** Prove impact.

**8. Design System:**

- Color palette, typography, components
- Style guide page

**Purpose:** Show systems thinking, consistency.

**Visual Quality:**

**Do:**

- ✅ High resolution (2x, at least 1920px wide)
- ✅ Consistent style (mockups, colors, fonts)
- ✅ Real content (not Lorem ipsum) or realistic placeholder
- ✅ Annotate when helpful (arrows, labels, explanations)
- ✅ Show in context (device mockups, real environments)

**Don't:**

- ❌ Low resolution (blurry, pixelated)
- ❌ Inconsistent mockup styles (mixing different templates)
- ❌ Too small (viewers squint to see)
- ❌ Cluttered (too many visuals, overwhelming)

**Tools for Mockups:**

- Figma (built-in device frames)
- Mockuuups (mockuuups.com)
- Cleanmock (cleanmock.com)
- Shots (shots.so)

### Showing Your Role

**If you worked on a team, clarify your role.**

**State Clearly:**
"Role: Lead UX Designer (team of 5)"
"My responsibilities: User research, wireframing, usability testing"

**In Narrative:**
Use "I" for your work, "we" for team efforts.

**Example:**
"I conducted user interviews with 10 participants. Based on insights, we (team) brainstormed solutions. I then created wireframes and tested them with users."

**What to Avoid:**

❌ **Taking Credit for Others' Work:**
Don't say "I" if you didn't do it.

❌ **Being Vague:**
"We designed" → Who specifically did what?

**If You're the Only Designer:**
Simple: "Role: UX/UI Designer (solo project)"

### Tailoring Case Studies to Audience

**Different audiences care about different things.**

**Startup Founders:**

- **Care about:** Impact, speed, business outcomes
- **Emphasize:** Metrics, how design drove growth, moving fast

**Large Company UX Teams:**

- **Care about:** Process, collaboration, rigor
- **Emphasize:** Research methods, testing, iteration, working with cross-functional teams

**Agencies:**

- **Care about:** Versatility, client management, visual polish
- **Emphasize:** Diverse projects, stakeholder management, polished visuals

**Researchers:**

- **Care about:** Research rigor, methodology, insights
- **Emphasize:** Research process, synthesis, how research informed design

**How to Tailor:**

**Content:**
Adjust emphasis (spend more words on what they care about).

**Tone:**

- Startup: Direct, results-focused, scrappy
- Corporate: Structured, collaborative, thorough
- Agency: Creative, polished, client-focused

**Case Selection:**
Choose projects that align with role.

**Example:**
Applying to research-heavy role? Lead with case study showcasing extensive research.

**You Can Have Multiple Versions:**
Slight variations for different applications (adjust intro, emphasize different aspects).

### Common Case Study Formats

**1. Web Page (Portfolio Site):**

- **Pros:** Interactive, can embed prototypes, unlimited length (scroll)
- **Cons:** Requires website
- **Tools:** Personal site (Webflow, Framer, Squarespace), Notion, Behance, Dribbble

**2. PDF:**

- **Pros:** Portable, shareable, retains formatting
- **Cons:** Can be large files, not interactive
- **Tools:** Figma (export as PDF), InDesign, PowerPoint/Keynote → PDF

**3. Presentation Deck:**

- **Pros:** Good for presenting, linear flow
- **Cons:** Less detail (slides limit content)
- **Tools:** Figma, PowerPoint, Keynote, Google Slides

**4. Video Walkthrough:**

- **Pros:** Engaging, shows personality, can narrate
- **Cons:** Time-intensive to create, viewers may not watch full video
- **Tools:** Loom, Screen recording + editing

**Most Common: Web Page or PDF**

**Recommendation:**

- **Primary:** Web page (on portfolio site)
- **Backup:** PDF version (for emailing, printing)

### Length and Depth

**How Long Should a Case Study Be?**

**Too Short (<500 words):**
Not enough detail, doesn't show process.

**Too Long (>3000 words):**
Overwhelming, people won't read it all.

**Sweet Spot: 800-1500 words**

- Enough detail to show process
- Concise enough to hold attention
- Scannable (headings, bullets, visuals break it up)

**If You Have More to Say:**

- Use collapsible sections ("Read more...")
- Link to appendix ("See full research report →")
- Prioritize (what's essential? what can be cut?)

**Depth:**

**Show Enough Detail:**

- ✅ Research: How many participants? What methods? Key insights?
- ✅ Design: Why these choices? What alternatives did you consider?
- ✅ Testing: How many users? What did you learn? What changed?

**But Not Every Detail:**

- ❌ Don't include every sketch (pick best 3-5)
- ❌ Don't explain every button (focus on key features)
- ❌ Don't list every piece of feedback (synthesize)

### Showing Iteration and Failure

**Don't Present Sanitized "Perfect" Process:**
Real design is messy. Show it.

**Show Iteration:**

**Example:**
"Version 1: Users found the navigation confusing. Version 2: I simplified to 3 main categories. Version 3: After testing, I added icons for scannability. Final: Users successfully navigated in 8/8 tests."

**Include Visuals:**
Side-by-side: Version 1 vs Final.

**Why This Matters:**

- Shows you iterate based on feedback (not ego-driven)
- Shows growth mindset
- More authentic (hiring managers know design isn't perfect on first try)

**Acknowledge Failures:**

**Example:**
"Initially, I designed a complex filtering system with 15 options. Usability testing revealed users were overwhelmed and ignored it entirely. I pivoted to a simpler approach with 3 primary filters and a 'More filters' option, which tested significantly better."

**Why This Matters:**

- Honesty builds trust
- Shows resilience (failure → learn → improve)
- Shows user-centered approach (willing to change based on data)

**What Not to Do:**

- ❌ Hide failures (presents unrealistic picture)
- ❌ Blame others ("The developer implemented it wrong")
- ❌ Dwell on failure (mention, then move to solution)

### Writing About Constraints

**Real projects have constraints: budget, time, technology, stakeholders.**

**Acknowledge Them:**

**Example:**
"Due to engineering constraints, we couldn't implement real-time data syncing. Instead, I designed a manual refresh button with clear feedback to manage user expectations."

**Why This Matters:**

- Shows you can design within real-world limitations (not just ideal scenarios)
- Demonstrates problem-solving (given X constraint, I did Y)
- Builds credibility (you've worked on real projects, not just school projects)

**Balance:**

- ✅ Acknowledge constraints
- ✅ Explain how you worked with them
- ❌ Don't sound like you're making excuses

**Example Frame:**
"While [constraint], I [creative solution], which [positive outcome]."

### Confidentiality and NDAs

**If you worked at a company, you may have signed NDA (non-disclosure agreement).**

**What You Can/Can't Share:**

**Check Your NDA:**

- Some prohibit sharing any work
- Some allow sharing after product launch
- Some allow sharing with obscured details (company name, specific metrics)

**When in Doubt:**

- Ask your manager or legal team
- Better safe than sued

**Options if You Can't Share:**

**1. Genericize:**
Remove company name, logo, specific metrics.

**Example:**
"Redesigned checkout flow for a major e-commerce platform, increasing conversions by X%."

**2. Personal/Side Projects:**
Include projects you own (not bound by NDA).

**3. Case Study Without Visuals:**
Describe process, learnings (without showing designs).

**Example:**
"Due to confidentiality, I can't share visuals, but I can discuss my process and approach. In interviews, I'm happy to provide more details under NDA."

**4. Password-Protected:**
Share with password only (provide to hiring managers).

**5. Request Permission:**
Some companies grant permission if you ask.

**Note:**
If you can't share any work from your job, focus on:

- Side projects
- Freelance work
- School/bootcamp projects
- Volunteer work

- What do they emphasize? (research? visuals? metrics?)

**Writing:**

- How do they explain decisions?
- What's their tone? (formal? conversational?)
- How much detail?

**Visuals:**

- What images do they include?
- How are they presented? (mockups? annotations? GIFs?)
- Quality level?

**Outcome:**

- How do they show impact?
- Do they have metrics?

**Analyze 5-10 Case Studies:**
Note what works, what doesn't. Apply learnings to your own.

### Common Case Study Mistakes

**1. No Context (Problem Unclear):**
Jumping straight to designs without explaining problem.

**Fix:** Start with problem statement. Why does this matter?

**2. Process Not Shown:**
Only showing final designs.

**Fix:** Include research, wireframes, iterations. Show journey.

**3. Vague Outcomes:**
"It was successful" (no specifics).

**Fix:** Metrics, quotes, specific results.

**4. Too Much Text, Not Enough Visuals:**
Walls of text.

**Fix:** Break up with images, bullets, headings.

**5. Too Many Visuals, Not Enough Explanation:**
Designs without context.

**Fix:** Every visual needs caption or explanation (why is this here?).

**6. Unclear Role:**
Can't tell what you actually did.

**Fix:** State role clearly. Use "I" for your work.

**7. No Reflection:**
Doesn't mention learnings or what you'd improve.

**Fix:** Add "Reflections" section. Shows growth mindset.

**8. Too Polished (Fake Feeling):**
No iteration, no failure, perfect project.

**Fix:** Show messiness. Authenticity builds trust.

**9. Jargon/Technical Terms:**
Assuming reader knows UX terminology.

**Fix:** Write for general audience. Explain terms if needed.

**10. Boring Title:**
"Project 1"

**Fix:** Descriptive, intriguing. "Redesigning Healthcare Scheduling for Busy Parents"

### Best Practices

**Do:**

- ✅ Start with strong problem statement (hook interest)
- ✅ Show process (research, wireframes, iterations)
- ✅ Explain decisions (why, not just what)
- ✅ Include metrics or outcomes (prove impact)
- ✅ Use high-quality visuals (2x resolution, professional mockups)
- ✅ Show iteration (before/after, multiple versions)
- ✅ Be honest (acknowledge constraints, failures, learnings)
- ✅ Make it scannable (headings, bullets, short paragraphs)
- ✅ Clarify your role (especially for team projects)
- ✅ Proofread (typos undermine professionalism)

**Don't:**

- ❌ Skip research/process (only show final designs)
- ❌ Be vague (generic statements without specifics)
- ❌ Use low-quality images (blurry, pixelated)
- ❌ Write walls of text (readers scan, not read)
- ❌ Present unrealistic perfection (show real process)
- ❌ Violate NDAs (check before sharing)
- ❌ Forget to explain (designs need context)
- ❌ Include too many projects (3-5 strong case studies > 10 weak)

## Practice Exercises

1. **Case Study Outline:** Choose a completed project (capstone, work, freelance). Create detailed outline:

   - Problem statement
   - Research (methods, insights)
   - Design process (key phases)
   - Solution (key features)
   - Outcome (metrics or results)
   - Learnings
     Don't write full case study yet—just outline (bullet points). This helps clarify structure before investing time.

2. **Write Problem Statement:** For 3 different projects, write compelling problem statements (2-3 sentences each):

   - What's the problem?
   - Who's affected?
   - Why does it matter?
     Compare to vague versions ("Make app better"). Feel the difference?

3. **Before/After Visuals:** Find a project where you iterated. Create 3 before/after comparisons:

   - Wireframe V1 vs Final
   - Initial design vs After testing
   - Old flow vs New flow
     Add captions explaining what changed and why. This is powerful visual storytelling.

4. **Analyze 5 Case Studies:** Find 5 strong UX case studies on Behance or Dribbble. For each, note:

   - Structure (sections, order)
   - Strengths (what's excellent?)
   - Weaknesses (what's missing or confusing?)
   - Key takeaway (what can you apply to yours?)
     Create comparison table or document. This research informs your approach.

5. **Write Outcome Section:** For a project, write outcome/impact section (150-200 words):

   - Quantitative results (metrics, if available)
   - Qualitative results (feedback, quotes)
   - What was achieved?
   - What would you measure if you had more time?
     This is often the hardest section—practice it.

6. **Get Feedback on Draft:** Write first draft of one case study. Share with 3 people (designers, friends, mentors). Ask specific questions:
   - Is the problem clear?
   - Can you follow my process?
   - Are visuals helpful or overwhelming?
   - What's confusing?
   - Would you hire me based on this?
     Revise based on feedback. Iterate on case study like you iterate on designs.
