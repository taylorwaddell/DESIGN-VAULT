# Portfolio

## Introduction

Your portfolio is your most powerful career tool—more impactful than your resume, more persuasive than your LinkedIn, more revealing than any interview. While a resume lists credentials, a portfolio proves capability. It answers the fundamental hiring question: "Can this person do the job?" For designers, showing is infinitely more convincing than telling. A strong portfolio doesn't just display finished work—it demonstrates your thinking, process, range, and growth. It's the difference between "I'm a good designer" (claim) and "Here's proof I solved complex problems for real users" (evidence).

The challenge of portfolio-building is curation and presentation. You must be ruthlessly selective (quality over quantity), strategic about what you showcase (play to your strengths), and thoughtful about how you present it (context matters more than just pretty pictures). Your portfolio must serve multiple purposes: get you interviews (stand out from hundreds of applicants), facilitate conversations (give interviewers material to discuss), and close opportunities (convince decision-makers you're the right hire). It must work hard when you're not there—clear, compelling, and complete enough to tell your story without you present.

Mastering portfolio creation means understanding what different audiences value (startups vs agencies vs enterprises), how to structure projects for maximum impact (problem → solution → outcome), and how to maintain and evolve your portfolio over time (it's never "done"). It requires honest self-assessment (what are your true strengths?), continuous documentation (capture work in progress, not just finals), and strategic thinking (what opportunities do you want to attract?). Your portfolio is not a gallery—it's a persuasive argument for why someone should hire you.

## Learning Objectives

By mastering Portfolio creation, you will be able to:

- Curate and select projects that showcase your best work
- Structure your portfolio for maximum impact and clarity
- Choose appropriate platforms and tools for presentation
- Write compelling project descriptions and about pages
- Tailor your portfolio to different opportunities and audiences
- Maintain and update your portfolio systematically
- Present your portfolio effectively in interviews
- Build your personal brand through portfolio presence

## Key Knowledge Points

### What Makes a Strong Portfolio?

**Essential Elements:**

**1. Quality Over Quantity:**

- **Better:** 3-5 exceptional projects (deeply explained)
- **Worse:** 15 mediocre projects (no explanation)

**Why:** Hiring managers spend 2-5 minutes per portfolio. Show your best, not everything.

**2. Clear Project Context:**

- Problem, solution, process, outcome
- Not just pretty pictures
- See [[Case-Studies]] for structure

**3. Diverse Skills:**
Show range (if you have it):

- Research-heavy project
- Visual design project
- System thinking project (design system)
- Different industries (healthcare, e-commerce, etc.)

**4. Professional Presentation:**

- High-quality visuals (2x resolution)
- Consistent styling (mockups, typography, colors)
- Clear hierarchy (most important projects first)
- Easy navigation (clear menu, logical flow)

**5. About You:**
Who are you? What's your story? What do you care about?

**6. Contact Information:**
Email, LinkedIn (easy to reach you).

**Red Flags (What Hiring Managers Dislike):**

- ❌ **No context:** Pretty pictures without explanation
- ❌ **Too many projects:** 20 projects = diluted focus
- ❌ **Low quality:** Blurry images, typos, broken links
- ❌ **No process:** Only final designs (can't see thinking)
- ❌ **All spec work:** No real projects (school projects fine for juniors, but some real work preferred)
- ❌ **Hard to navigate:** Confusing menu, unclear structure
- ❌ **No contact info:** Want to hire you, can't find email

### Portfolio Structure

**Homepage:**

**Purpose:** First impression, quick overview.

**Elements:**

**1. Intro:**

- Your name
- What you do (e.g., "Product Designer specializing in healthcare")
- Brief statement (1-2 sentences)

**Example:**
"Hi, I'm Jordan. I'm a product designer who loves solving complex problems for everyday people. Currently designing at HealthTech Co."

**2. Featured Projects:**

- 3-5 projects (cards or tiles)
- Each with: Title, brief description (1 sentence), image (hero shot)
- Click → full case study

**3. Navigation:**

- Clear menu: Projects, About, Contact
- Optional: Resume/CV link

**Alternative Homepage Approach:**

**Full-page hero:**

- Large image or video (your best work)
- Your name + title
- "View Projects" button

**Scrolling grid:**

- Immediately show project thumbnails (no intro paragraph)
- Click any to see case study

**Choose based on:**

- **Traditional industries (corporate):** Clean, professional homepage with intro
- **Creative industries (startups, agencies):** Bold, visual-first approach

**Project Pages (Case Studies):**

See [[Case-Studies]] for detailed structure.

**Key Components:**

1. Project overview (role, timeline, tools)
2. Problem statement
3. Process (research, design, testing)
4. Solution (final designs, prototype)
5. Outcome (metrics, impact)
6. Reflection (learnings)

**About Page:**

**Purpose:** Humanize you, build connection.

**Elements:**

**1. Photo:**
Professional headshot (smiling, approachable).

**Why:** Builds trust, shows you're real.

**2. Bio:**

- Who you are (background, journey to design)
- What you do (focus, specialization)
- What you care about (values, interests)
- Personal touch (hobbies, fun facts)

**Length:** 150-300 words.

**Example:**

"I'm a product designer with a background in psychology, which shapes how I approach design—always starting with people. I've spent the last 5 years designing healthcare tools that make complex medical information accessible to patients.

When I'm not designing, I'm usually hiking with my dog or experimenting with sourdough baking (the starter is temperamental, much like design feedback). I believe great design is invisible—it just works.

I'm currently looking for opportunities to join a mission-driven team solving problems in education or sustainability."

**3. Skills (Optional):**
List key skills (UX research, prototyping, Figma, etc.).

**Format:** Simple list or visuals (icons).

**4. Tools (Optional):**
Tools you use (Figma, Sketch, etc.).

**Format:** Logos.

**5. Resume/CV:**
Link to downloadable PDF.

**6. Contact:**
Email, LinkedIn.

**Contact:**

Simple page or section with:

- Email
- LinkedIn
- Optional: Twitter, Dribbble, Behance, GitHub (if relevant)
- Optional: Contact form (but email is fine)

**Make It Easy:**
Don't make people hunt for your email. Prominent on every page (header or footer).

### Selecting Projects

**How Many Projects?**

**Recommended: 3-5 projects.**

**Why:**

- **Too few (<3):** Not enough evidence of skills
- **Too many (>6):** Overwhelming, dilutes focus

**Quality over quantity.** Better to have 3 exceptional projects than 10 mediocre ones.

**Which Projects to Include?**

**Criteria:**

**1. Quality:**
Your best work (design, process, outcome).

**2. Impact:**
Projects with measurable outcomes or clear success stories.

**3. Recency:**
Ideally from last 2-3 years (unless older work is exceptional).

**4. Diversity:**
Show range:

- Different skills (research, UI, systems)
- Different types (mobile, web, responsive)
- Different industries (if applicable)

**5. Story:**
Projects with interesting problems and solutions.

**6. Alignment:**
Projects relevant to jobs you're applying for.

**Example:**
Applying to healthcare role? Include healthcare project.

**7. Completion:**
Finished projects (not abandoned half-way).

**What If You Don't Have 3-5 Strong Projects?**

**Options:**

**1. Personal Projects:**
Redesign an app you use, design something you wish existed.

**Pros:** Full control, can showcase ideal process.
**Cons:** No real constraints or stakeholders (less realistic).

**Make It Strong:**

- Real problem (research with real users)
- Treat it professionally (full process, testing)
- Be honest ("Personal project to explore X")

**2. Volunteer Work:**
Offer to design for nonprofits, small businesses.

**Pros:** Real client, real constraints, meaningful impact.
**Cons:** May not pay, client may be difficult.

**3. Redesigns:**
Take existing product, identify problems, redesign.

**Pros:** Clear before/after.
**Cons:** Need to justify (why is current design bad? did you research?).

**Make It Strong:**

- Don't just say "I think this is ugly"—research actual user problems
- Test your redesign with users
- Be respectful (don't bash existing design)

**4. Spec Projects:**
Fake projects (design for imaginary company).

**Pros:** Total creative freedom.
**Cons:** Clearly fake (less impressive than real projects).

**For Juniors/Students:** Spec projects are fine (expected).
**For Mid/Senior:** Real projects preferred (shows you've worked professionally).

**5. Expand Existing Projects:**
Turn thin projects into full case studies (add research, testing, reflection).

**Project Order:**

**Best First:**
Put strongest project first (many viewers won't see beyond first 1-2).

**Exception:**
If applying to specific role, put most relevant project first (even if not your absolute best).

**Example:**
Applying to fintech company? Lead with your banking app redesign.

### Platform and Format

**Where to Host Your Portfolio?**

**Options:**

**1. Portfolio Platforms:**

**Behance (behance.net):**

- **Pros:** Free, built-in audience, easy to use, Adobe integration
- **Cons:** Less customization, everyone uses it (harder to stand out)
- **Best for:** Beginners, designers who want quick setup

**Dribbble (dribbble.com):**

- **Pros:** Designer community, good for networking
- **Cons:** More showcase than case studies (favors visuals over process), Pro account required for full portfolio features
- **Best for:** Visual designers, building reputation in community

**Cofolios (cofolios.com):**

- **Pros:** Designed for UX portfolios, case study focus
- **Cons:** Less known, smaller community
- **Best for:** UX designers wanting clean, process-focused portfolio

**Notion (notion.so):**

- **Pros:** Free, easy to update, flexible
- **Cons:** Not designed for portfolios (less visual polish), everyone's Notion portfolios look similar
- **Best for:** Quick portfolio, internal use (not public-facing ideal)

**2. Website Builders:**

**Webflow (webflow.com):**

- **Pros:** High customization, no code (visual builder), professional results
- **Cons:** Learning curve, paid plans for custom domain
- **Best for:** Designers wanting unique, polished portfolio

**Framer (framer.com):**

- **Pros:** Easy to use, beautiful templates, good for motion/interaction
- **Cons:** Relatively new as website builder
- **Best for:** Designers wanting interactive portfolios

**Squarespace (squarespace.com):**

- **Pros:** Beautiful templates, easy setup, good for beginners
- **Cons:** Less customization than Webflow, monthly fee
- **Best for:** Designers wanting professional site with minimal setup

**Cargo (cargo.site):**

- **Pros:** Designed for creatives, beautiful templates
- **Cons:** Monthly fee
- **Best for:** Portfolio-first (not blog/business site)

**Wix (wix.com):**

- **Pros:** Very easy, drag-and-drop
- **Cons:** Can look generic, less designer-credibility
- **Best for:** Non-designers (if you're a designer, shows you can't design?)

**3. Custom-Coded Website:**

**Pros:**

- Total control
- Showcase coding skills (if relevant)
- Unique

**Cons:**

- Time-intensive
- Requires development skills
- Maintenance (updates, hosting)

**Tools:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript, React, Next.js, Gatsby, etc.

**Recommendation:**

**Beginners/Quick Setup:** Behance or Squarespace.

**Mid-Level UX Designers:** Personal website (Webflow, Framer, Squarespace).

**Visual/UI Designers:** Dribbble + personal website.

**Developers/Technical Designers:** Custom-coded site.

**All Designers:** Have presence on Behance or Dribbble (community, networking) + personal website (more control).

**Domain:**

**yourname.com > portfolio platforms.**

**Why:**

- Professional
- Memorable
- You control it (platforms can change)

**Cost:** $10-15/year (cheap investment).

**If your name is taken:**

- yourname.design
- yournameco.com
- firstlast.com

**Avoid:**

- yourname123.com (looks unprofessional)
- weird TLDs (.ninja, .rocks) unless it fits your brand

### Visual Presentation

**Design Quality:**

**Your portfolio IS a design project.**

If your portfolio looks bad, hiring managers assume your work looks bad.

**Best Practices:**

**1. Consistent Styling:**

- Same mockup style throughout (don't mix random templates)
- Consistent typography (1-2 fonts)
- Consistent colors (your brand colors)

**2. High-Resolution Images:**

- 2x resolution minimum (retina displays)
- At least 1920px wide for full-width images

**3. Visual Hierarchy:**

- Most important projects → larger, first
- Clear headings (section titles)
- White space (breathing room, not cramped)

**4. Mockups:**
Show designs in context (phone, laptop, etc.).

**Tools:**

- Figma (built-in device frames)
- Mockuuups (mockuuups.com)
- Cleanmock (cleanmock.com)
- Shots (shots.so)

**5. Annotations:**
Highlight key features, interactions (arrows, labels).

**6. Real Content:**
Use real content (or realistic placeholder).

**Avoid:** Lorem ipsum (looks lazy).

**7. Show Flows:**
Multiple screens showing user journey.

**Example:**
Onboarding Flow: Screen 1 → Screen 2 → Screen 3.

**8. Prototypes:**

- Embedded videos (Loom, screen recording)
- GIFs (show micro-interactions)
- Links to live prototypes

**Interactive is more engaging than static screenshots.**

**9. Before/After:**
Show improvement (especially for redesigns).

Side-by-side: "Before: cluttered | After: clean."

**10. Design System (if applicable):**
Show color palette, typography, components.

**Demonstrates systems thinking.**

**Common Visual Mistakes:**

**❌ Low-quality images** (blurry, pixelated)
**❌ Inconsistent mockups** (mixing different templates)
**❌ Too cluttered** (too many images, overwhelming)
**❌ Tiny text** (viewers can't read)
**❌ No context** (screenshot without explanation)
**❌ Bad photography** (if showing physical products, dark/blurry photos)

### Writing for Your Portfolio

**Tone:**

**Professional but personable.**

- Not too formal (not academic paper)
- Not too casual (not texts to friends)

**Use "I":**
Show ownership. "I designed" (not "The design was created").

**Be Conversational:**
Write like you speak (to a degree).

**Avoid jargon:**
Not everyone knows UX terms. Explain if needed.

**Project Descriptions:**

**For Project Cards (Homepage):**
1 sentence, intriguing.

**Example:**
"Redesigning prescription refills to reduce patient confusion and pharmacy calls."

**For Case Studies:**
See [[Case-Studies]] for full writing guide.

**Key Points:**

- Start with problem (hook interest)
- Explain decisions (why, not just what)
- Use metrics (increased X by Y%)
- Be specific (not vague)
- Keep scannable (headings, bullets, short paragraphs)

**About Page:**

**Tell Your Story:**

- How did you get into design?
- What do you care about?
- What makes you unique?

**Be Authentic:**
Let personality show (humor, passion, quirks).

**Example:**

**Generic:**
"I'm a UX designer with 3 years of experience."

**Better:**
"I accidentally fell into design after a psychology degree and a failed startup. Turns out, understanding people + building products = perfect fit."

**Show, Don't Just Tell:**

- ❌ "I'm passionate about accessibility."
- ✅ "I ensure every project meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards—because design should work for everyone, not just some."

**Contact:**

Make it easy.

**Clear CTA:**
"Let's work together. Email me at [email]"

**Optional:**
"I'm currently looking for [type of role] opportunities."

### Personal Branding

**Your portfolio is part of your brand.**

**What is Personal Brand?**
How people perceive you professionally.

**Consistency Across Channels:**

**Portfolio, LinkedIn, Resume, Behance, Dribbble:**

- Same photo (professional headshot)
- Same bio (adjusted for platform, but core message consistent)
- Same tone (professional but personable, or formal, or quirky—whatever fits you)

**Define Your Brand:**

**What do you want to be known for?**

- "User researcher who loves messy, complex problems"
- "Visual designer who makes data beautiful"
- "Design systems specialist"
- "Healthcare UX designer"

**How to Communicate This:**

- **Portfolio:** Projects demonstrate this focus
- **About page:** Explicitly state it
- **LinkedIn headline:** "Healthcare UX Designer | Making medical tools human-centered"

**Visual Identity (Optional but Helpful):**

- Logo or wordmark (your name, stylized)
- Color palette (2-3 colors that represent you)
- Typography (1-2 fonts)

**Use across:**

- Portfolio site
- Resume
- Business cards (if you have them)

**Consistency builds recognition.**

### Tailoring Your Portfolio

**Should you have one portfolio for all applications?**

**Ideal: One primary portfolio + slight adjustments for specific opportunities.**

**How to Tailor:**

**1. Project Order:**
Put most relevant project first.

**Example:**
Applying to healthcare role? Lead with healthcare project.

**2. About Page:**
Adjust closing statement.

**Generic:**
"I'm currently looking for new opportunities."

**Tailored:**
"I'm currently seeking opportunities to apply my design skills to healthcare challenges."

**3. Highlight Relevant Skills:**
If applying to research-heavy role, emphasize research in project descriptions.

**4. Custom Case Study (Advanced):**
For dream job, create custom case study showing how you'd approach their problem.

**Example:**
Applying to Spotify? Design solution for one of their known challenges.

**Pros:** Shows initiative, passion, fit.
**Cons:** Time-intensive (only for top opportunities).

**What NOT to Do:**
Don't create entirely different portfolios for each application (unsustainable).

### Maintaining Your Portfolio

**Your portfolio is never "done."**

**Update Regularly:**

**When to Update:**

- **Completed new project:** Add it (remove weakest old project if needed)
- **New job:** Update About page (current role)
- **New skills:** Update skills section
- **Applying to jobs:** Refresh before application season

**How Often:**

- **Active job search:** Monthly
- **Employed, not searching:** Every 6 months

**What to Update:**

**1. Projects:**

- Add new, strong projects
- Remove weaker projects (as you grow)
- Update case studies (add metrics from launched projects)

**2. About Page:**

- Current role/status
- New skills
- Updated photo (every 2-3 years)

**3. Resume:**
Keep downloadable resume current.

**4. Contact Info:**
If you change email, update everywhere.

**Version Control:**

Save old versions before major updates.

**Why:**

- You might want to revert
- You can see your growth (compare portfolio from 2 years ago)

**How:**

- Duplicate site (Webflow, Figma)
- Export PDF (snapshot in time)
- GitHub (if custom-coded)

**Broken Links:**

**Check Regularly:**

- Prototype links (do they still work?)
- External links (articles, resources)
- Images (loading correctly?)

**Tool:** Broken link checkers (e.g., Screaming Frog, online tools)

**Analytics (Optional but Useful):**

**Add Google Analytics or similar.**

**Track:**

- Page views (which projects get most views?)
- Time on page (are people reading or bouncing?)
- Traffic sources (where are viewers coming from?)

**Use Data:**

- If project gets low views, maybe it's weak (consider removing)
- If bounce rate is high, maybe homepage isn't clear (iterate)

### Presenting Your Portfolio in Interviews

**Portfolio is conversation starter.**

**Before Interview:**

**1. Review Your Own Portfolio:**

- Refresh on details (metrics, decisions)
- Be ready to discuss any project in depth

**2. Prepare Stories:**
For each project:

- **Challenge:** What was hard?
- **Decision:** Key decision you made and why
- **Outcome:** What happened?
- **Learning:** What did you learn?

**3. Anticipate Questions:**

- "Walk me through your process"
- "Why did you choose X?"
- "What would you do differently?"
- "How did you handle [constraint/feedback/conflict]?"

**During Interview:**

**1. Let Them Choose:**
"Would you like me to walk through a project, or do you have questions?"

Some interviewers want full walkthrough, others prefer Q&A.

**2. Don't Memorize Script:**
Speak naturally, conversationally.

**3. Focus on Thinking, Not Just Designs:**
Explain why, not just what.

**4. Tell Stories:**
Specific examples, not generic statements.

**Example:**

**Generic:**
"I iterate based on user feedback."

**Specific Story:**
"In usability testing, 6 out of 8 users couldn't find the search feature. I realized it was too subtle, so I made it more prominent and tested again—8 out of 8 users found it immediately."

**5. Be Honest:**
If something didn't work, say so. Shows learning.

**6. Time Management:**
Don't spend 20 minutes on one project (unless they ask).

**Rule of Thumb:** 3-5 minutes per project walkthrough.

**7. Read the Room:**

- If they seem engaged, continue
- If they're checking time, wrap up

**After Interview:**

**Send Follow-Up:**
Thank them, include portfolio link again (easy reference).

See [[Feedback-and-Critique]] for more on presenting work.

## Practice Exercises

1. **Portfolio Audit:** If you have an existing portfolio, audit it against checklist above:

   - Content (case studies, process, outcomes)
   - Visual quality (resolution, consistency)
   - Navigation (easy to use?)
   - Writing (typos, clarity)
   - Technical (broken links, mobile-responsive)
     Create list of improvements needed. Prioritize (most critical first).

2. **Competitive Analysis:** Find 5 portfolios of designers you admire (search "[role] portfolio" or browse Behance):

   - What makes them strong?
   - What structure do they use?
   - How do they present projects?
   - What would you do differently?
     Create document with notes and screenshots. Apply learnings to your own portfolio.

3. **About Page Draft:** Write 3 different versions of your About page bio (150-250 words each):

   - Version 1: Formal, professional
   - Version 2: Conversational, personable
   - Version 3: Creative, bold
     Get feedback from 3 people. Which resonates most? Which feels authentic to you?

4. **Project Selection:** List all projects you could include. For each, rate (1-10):

   - Quality (design, execution)
   - Impact (measurable outcome or success)
   - Story (interesting problem/solution)
   - Relevance (to jobs you want)
   - Recency (how old?)
     Select top 3-5 based on scores. These are your portfolio projects.

5. **Visual Consistency Test:** Gather all mockups/images you plan to use:

   - Are they consistent style?
   - Same resolution?
   - Same mockup templates?
   - Cohesive feel?
     If not, recreate with consistent approach (same mockup tool, same style).

6. **User Test Your Portfolio:** Have 3 people review your portfolio (send link, watch them browse):
   - Can they navigate easily?
   - Do they understand your role in each project?
   - Do they find contact info?
   - What's confusing?
   - Would they hire you based on this?
     Take notes (don't defend, just listen). Iterate based on feedback. This is usability testing your own product (portfolio).
