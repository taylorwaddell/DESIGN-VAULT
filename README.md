## Phase 1 — Visual Design Fundamentals (Color, Type, Composition, Principles)

**Goal:** Build the eye: reliable color choices, clear hierarchy, balanced layouts.

**Key Topics**

- Color theory → [[Color-Theory]] | [[Color-Harmonies]] | [[Contrast-and-Accessibility]]
- Typography → [[Typography]] | [[Type-Hierarchy]]
- Layout & composition → [[Layout-and-Composition]] | [[Grid-Systems]] | [[White-Space]]
- Design principles → [[Design-Principles]] | [[Gestalt-Principles]]
- Brief design history → [[Design-History]]

**Self‑Guided Resources**

- Color: Webflow blog (color theory), Coolors/Adobe Color.
- Type: _Thinking with Type_ (Lupton), Figma “What is Typography?” guide.
- Layout: GCF LearnFree “Layout & Composition”, Material/Apple HIG layout docs.
- Principles: Laws of UX, Gestalt primers (IxDF/NN/g summaries).

**Structured Options**

- Coursera: _Fundamentals of Graphic Design_ (CalArts).
- IxDF: _Visual Design_ course.
- Book: _The Non‑Designer’s Design Book_ (Williams).

**Practice (pick 2–3)**

1. **Color+Type study:** Rebuild a favorite screen’s palette & type, then reskin with an alternate palette.
2. **Gestalt sketches:** Grouping via proximity/common region; test with a friend: “what’s related/primary?”
3. **Poster/flyer cleanup:** Re‑layout a bad example using grid, margins, hierarchy.
4. **A11y check:** Run text/background through a contrast checker; adjust until WCAG AA passes.

**Next Steps**

- Be fluent with terms (x‑height, leading, complementary, 8‑pt grid). Move on when you can explain your choices.

3. **Pixel‑perfect clone:** Rebuild 2–3 real components; measure paddings, radii, states.
4. **Heuristic review:** Run your screen through the 10 heuristics; log 3 fixes.
5. **Mini style guide:** Colors, text styles, spacing, buttons (default/hover/active), inputs (normal/error).

**Next Steps**

- Comfort with Figma + a few polished screens and a basic style guide.

2. **Guerrilla interview:** 10–15 min with a target user; list 5 insights.
3. **Card sort → sitemap:** Group features/content; propose nav and hierarchy.
4. **User flow:** Diagram “reset password” or “checkout” with decisions and errors.
5. **Paper prototype + test:** 3–5 tasks; note hesitations; iterate.

**Next Steps**

- Have artifacts (personas, flows, sitemap) and a validated concept.

- Networking → [[Networking]]
- Portfolio & case studies → [[Portfolio]] | [[Case-Studies]]
- Measuring impact → [[Design-Metrics]]
- Continuous learning → [[Continuous-Learning]]

**Do This Regularly**

- Post work to r/design_critiques, Designer Hangout, Discords; ask **specific** questions.
- Book ADPList mentor calls; show updates based on prior feedback.
- Join meetups/hackathons; give & receive structured critique (LISA: Like, Improve, Suggest, Ask).
- Share learnings publicly (threads, mini‑case studies). Teaching cements mastery.

---

## Weekly Rhythm (fits ~4 hrs/wk)

- **2 hrs** study (read/watch) → **90 min** practice (build) → **30 min** share/reflect.
- Keep a “**What I changed & why**” log after each critique/test.

---

## Tool Stack (starter)

- **Design:** Figma (+ FigJam), Google Fonts, Icon sets (Lucide/Material).
- **A11y:** Stark/Contrast tools, Wave (when in code).
- **Docs:** Notion (journal, case studies, system docs).
- **Build (optional):** Webflow for responsive prototypes/portfolio.

---

## Milestones

- **M1:** Phase 1–2 exercises + mini style guide.
- **M2:** Research artifacts + tested paper prototype.
- **M3:** Hi‑fi prototype with animation + a11y audit.
- **M4:** Capstone case study published + portfolio v1.
- **M5:** Design system v1 + regular critique cadence.

### Final Advice

Obsess over **clarity** (hierarchy, copy, spacing) and **consistency** (tokens, components) while staying relentlessly **user‑centered**. Iterate in public; let real usage and feedback shape your taste and judgment. Mastery is miles of _deliberate_ reps.
