# User Interviews

## Introduction

User interviews are structured conversations with target users designed to uncover their needs, behaviors, motivations, and pain points. Unlike casual conversations, user interviews follow a research protocol—prepared questions, active listening techniques, and careful documentation—to extract insights that inform design decisions. A well-conducted interview reveals not just what users do, but why they do it, providing the context and empathy essential for creating solutions that truly serve their needs.

User interviews are one of the most versatile and powerful tools in the UX researcher's toolkit. They work at any stage of the design process: early on to discover problems and opportunities, mid-process to validate concepts, or late-stage to understand how users experience a product. While [[Surveys]] provide breadth across many users, interviews provide depth—the rich stories, unexpected details, and "aha" moments that surveys can't capture.

The art of interviewing lies in asking the right questions, listening without judgment, and creating a comfortable environment where users feel safe sharing honest feedback. A skilled interviewer guides the conversation without leading it, follows interesting tangents, and extracts meaningful insights even from what users don't explicitly say. Mastering this skill transforms assumptions into understanding.

## Learning Objectives

By mastering User Interviews, you will be able to:

- Plan and structure effective user interviews with clear objectives
- Write open-ended, non-leading interview questions
- Conduct interviews using active listening and probing techniques
- Avoid common interviewing biases and pitfalls
- Document and analyze interview data to extract insights
- Synthesize findings across multiple interviews into actionable themes
- Recruit appropriate participants for different research goals
- Adapt interview techniques for remote and in-person sessions

## Key Knowledge Points

### Interview Fundamentals

- [[User Interview]]

  - One-on-one conversation with a user
  - 30-60 minutes (most common)
  - Semi-structured: prepared questions + flexibility
  - Goals: Understand needs, behaviors, motivations, context, pain points
  - Qualitative method (depth over breadth)

- **When to Use Interviews:**

  - Early discovery (what problems exist?)
  - Concept validation (does this solution resonate?)
  - Understanding context (how do users work?)
  - Exploring motivations (why do users behave this way?)
  - Following up on survey/analytics findings

- **Interviews vs Other Methods:**
  - vs [[Surveys]]: Depth vs breadth
  - vs [[Usability-Testing]]: Exploration vs evaluation
  - vs [[Focus Groups]]: Individual vs group dynamics
  - vs [[Analytics]]: Why vs what

### Interview Planning

- [[Interview Goals]]

  - What do you need to learn?
  - What decisions will this inform?
  - Examples:
    - "Understand pain points in current workflow"
    - "Explore how users currently solve [problem]"
    - "Validate that concept addresses real needs"

- [[Research Questions]]

  - Specific questions research should answer
  - Not the same as interview questions
  - Example research question: "What prevents users from completing checkout?"
  - Will inform multiple interview questions

- [[Participant Criteria]]

  - Who should you interview?
  - Demographics (age, location, etc.)
  - Behaviors (uses competitor product, performs certain tasks)
  - Psychographics (attitudes, values)
  - **Tip:** Interview multiple user types if they exist
  - **Sample size:** 5-8 per user segment (diminishing returns after)

- [[Screener Survey]]

  - Short questionnaire to qualify participants
  - Filter for criteria
  - Examples: "Do you use [product type] at least once a week?"
  - See [[UX-Research]]

- [[Interview Protocol]]
  - Document containing:
    - Introduction script
    - Interview questions (with probes)
    - Wrap-up script
    - Consent form
  - Ensures consistency across interviews

### Writing Interview Questions

- [[Open-Ended Questions]]

  - Cannot be answered with yes/no
  - Encourages storytelling
  - **Examples:**
    - "Tell me about the last time you..."
    - "How do you currently..."
    - "What's challenging about..."
    - "Walk me through your process for..."

- [[Closed Questions]] (use sparingly)

  - Yes/no or short answers
  - OK for screening or factual info
  - **Examples:** "Do you use [tool]?" "How often?"
  - Follow up with "Why?" to go deeper

- **Avoid Leading Questions:**

  - ❌ "Don't you think this feature is confusing?"
  - ✅ "What do you think of this feature?"
  - ❌ "Would you like a dark mode?"
  - ✅ "How do you feel about the current color scheme?"

- **Avoid Solution-Focused Questions (early on):**

  - ❌ "Would you use a feature that does X?"
  - ✅ "Tell me about challenges you face when doing Y."
  - Understand problem before validating solutions

- [[Behavioral Questions]]
  - Focus on past actions (more reliable than hypotheticals)
  - ✅ "Tell me about the last time you booked a trip."
  - ❌ "Would you book a trip using this app?"
  - Past behavior predicts future behavior better than stated intentions

### Interview Structure

**Typical Flow (60-minute example):**

1. **Introduction (5 min)**

   - Welcome and build rapport
   - Explain purpose and process
   - Informed consent, permission to record
   - "No wrong answers, we're learning about your experience"

2. **Warm-Up (5 min)**

   - Easy, non-threatening questions
   - Build comfort
   - "Tell me a bit about yourself and what you do."

3. **Main Questions (40 min)**

   - Core research questions
   - Start broad, then narrow
   - Ask for stories and examples
   - Follow interesting tangents

4. **Concept Testing (if applicable, 10 min)**

   - Show designs, prototypes
   - Get reactions
   - Ask about understanding, value, concerns

5. **Wrap-Up (5 min)**
   - "Anything else you'd like to share?"
   - Thank participant
   - Explain next steps
   - Provide incentive

### Interview Techniques

- [[Active Listening]]

  - Focus fully on participant
  - Minimal interruptions
  - Note-taking without breaking eye contact
  - Body language: nodding, leaning in

- [[Follow-Up Probes]]

  - Dig deeper into interesting responses
  - **Phrases:**
    - "Tell me more about that."
    - "Why do you think that is?"
    - "Can you give me an example?"
    - "How did that make you feel?"
    - "What happened next?"
  - **The Five Whys:** Ask "why" multiple times to get to root cause

- [[Silence]]

  - Don't rush to fill pauses
  - Silence gives participants time to think
  - Often leads to deeper insights
  - Resist urge to jump in immediately

- [[Neutrality]]

  - Don't show approval/disapproval
  - Avoid: "That's a great idea!" or "Oh no!"
  - Stay curious and neutral
  - All feedback is valuable

- [[Redirection]]

  - If participant goes off-topic: "That's interesting. Let's come back to..."
  - If they ask what you think: "I'm curious about your perspective first."

- [[Show Don't Tell]]
  - If possible, observe actual behavior
  - "Could you show me how you currently do that?"
  - Actions reveal more than words

### Interview Logistics

- **Location:**

  - [[In-Person]]: User's environment (contextual) or neutral space
  - [[Remote]]: Zoom, Google Meet, Teams
  - Remote advantages: Convenient, cheaper, broader geography
  - In-person advantages: Body language, context, rapport

- **Recording:**

  - Always ask permission
  - Video (remote) or audio (in-person)
  - Tools: Zoom recording, Lookback, Otter.ai, phone
  - Backup: Two recording methods

- **Roles:**

  - [[Interviewer]]: Asks questions, guides conversation
  - [[Note-Taker]]: Documents responses, observations
  - Ideal: 2-person team (interviewer can focus on listening)

- **Duration:**

  - 30-45 min for focused topics
  - 60 min for broader exploration
  - 90 min max (attention spans)

- [[Incentives]]
  - Respect participants' time
  - $50-150/hour typical (varies by audience)
  - Gift cards, product credits, charitable donation

### Common Pitfalls

- **Leading the Witness:**

  - Revealing your opinion or desired answer
  - Asking yes/no questions that expect a certain answer

- **Talking Too Much:**

  - Interviewer should listen 80%, talk 20%
  - Let participant fill the space

- **Asking Hypotheticals:**

  - "Would you use this?" → Unreliable
  - Ask about past behavior instead

- **Not Probing Deeply:**

  - Accepting surface answers
  - Failing to ask "why?" and "tell me more"

- **Confirmation Bias:**

  - Only hearing what confirms your beliefs
  - Stay open to challenging findings

- **Interview Fatigue:**
  - Scheduling too many back-to-back
  - Take breaks, debrief between sessions

### Documentation & Note-Taking

- [[Interview Notes]]

  - Capture verbatim quotes (mark with quotes)
  - Observations about behavior, emotion, hesitation
  - Timestamps for video reference
  - Distinguis fact from interpretation

- [[Transcription]]

  - Convert recordings to text
  - Tools: Otter.ai, Rev, Trint
  - Partial transcription (key sections) vs full
  - Review transcript while listening (catch errors)

- [[Debrief]]
  - Immediately after interview: 15-min team discussion
  - What stood out?
  - Surprising insights?
  - Tentative themes?
  - Update interview guide if needed

### Analysis & Synthesis

- [[Coding]]

  - Tag quotes and observations with themes
  - Example codes: "pain point - checkout," "motivation - speed," "workaround"
  - Tools: Spreadsheets, Airtable, Dovetail, paper

- [[Affinity Mapping]]

  - Write insights on sticky notes (one per note)
  - Group similar insights
  - Identify patterns and themes
  - Collaborative with team
  - Tools: Miro, Figjam, physical wall

- [[Themes]]

  - Recurring patterns across interviews
  - **Example themes:**
    - "Users abandon checkout due to unexpected shipping costs"
    - "Users trust recommendations from friends over algorithms"
    - "Mobile context demands faster workflows"

- [[Prioritization]]
  - Not all insights are equal
  - Prioritize by:
    - **Frequency:** How many participants mentioned?
