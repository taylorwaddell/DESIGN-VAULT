# Journey Maps

## Introduction

A journey map is a visual narrative that chronicles the complete experience a person has with a product, service, or organization over time—from initial awareness through ongoing usage and beyond. Unlike [[User-Flows]] that document specific task steps, journey maps zoom out to capture the broader experience: What does a user think, feel, and do across multiple touchpoints, days, weeks, or even months? They reveal not just actions but emotions, pain points, opportunities, and the context surrounding each interaction.

Journey maps are storytelling tools that build empathy and shared understanding. By visualizing a user's experience from their perspective—including frustrations, delights, and unmet needs—teams align around user-centered priorities. They make abstract experiences concrete: "Here's where users feel confused," "This is where they almost give up," "This moment creates loyalty." Journey maps don't just document current reality; they illuminate where improvements will have the greatest impact.

Creating journey maps requires synthesizing insights from [[User-Research]]—interviews, observations, analytics—into a cohesive narrative arc. They bridge research and design: insights become visual stories that inspire solutions. Whether mapping a customer's first 30 days with a product, a patient's hospital visit, or a shopper's path to purchase, journey maps transform data into empathy and empathy into action.

## Key Knowledge Points

### Journey Map Fundamentals

- [[Journey Map]]

  - Visual story of user's experience over time
  - Captures: touchpoints, actions, thoughts, emotions, pain points
  - Timeline-based (hours, days, weeks, months)
  - Based on [[User-Research]], not assumptions
  - **Purpose:**
    - Build empathy
    - Identify pain points and opportunities
    - Align team on user experience
    - Prioritize improvements
    - Communicate research insights

- **When to Create Journey Maps:**

  - After [[User-Research]] (synthesize findings)
  - Early in design process (understand current state)
  - When redesigning experiences
  - To identify service gaps
  - To communicate user needs to stakeholders

- **Journey Map vs Other Tools:**
  - vs [[User-Flows]]: Journey = broad experience over time; Flow = specific task steps
  - vs [[Personas]]: Journey = experience; Persona = who the user is
  - vs [[Service Blueprint]]: Journey = user view; Blueprint = behind-the-scenes operations
  - Journey maps often reference personas and inform user flows

### Journey Map Components

**Core Elements:**

1. [[Persona / Actor]]

   - Who is this journey about?
   - Reference specific [[Personas]] from research
   - Include name, photo, brief context

2. [[Scenario]]

   - What is the user trying to accomplish?
   - What prompts this journey?
   - Example: "Sarah needs to find a new apartment"

3. [[Phases / Stages]]

   - Major sections of the journey
   - Chronological progression
   - Examples:
     - Awareness → Consideration → Purchase → Usage → Loyalty
     - Before → During → After (event/service)
     - Onboarding → Active Use → Reengagement

4. [[Touchpoints]]

   - Interactions between user and product/service
   - Examples: Website, app, email, phone call, in-store visit
   - Can be multiple touchpoints per phase

5. [[Actions]]

   - What the user does at each stage
   - Observable behaviors
   - Examples: "Searches Google," "Compares prices," "Calls support"

6. [[Thoughts / Mindset]]

   - What's going through the user's mind?
   - Questions, concerns, goals
   - Examples: "Will this work?", "Is this worth it?", "What if I fail?"

7. [[Emotions / Experience]]

   - How the user feels at each stage
   - Often visualized as emotion curve (high to low)
   - Examples: Excited, frustrated, confused, delighted, anxious
   - Can use emoticons, colors, or line graph

8. [[Pain Points]]

   - Problems, friction, frustrations
   - Moments where experience breaks down
   - Often marked with icons or red highlights
   - Examples: "Can't find information," "Long wait time," "Confusing checkout"

9. [[Opportunities]]
   - Areas for improvement
   - How might we address pain points?
   - Potential solutions or enhancements

**Optional Elements:**

- [[Channels]]: Where interaction happens (web, mobile, in-person, phone)
- [[Quotes]]: Actual user statements from research
- [[Metrics]]: Data points (bounce rate, time on page, NPS)
- [[Internal Ownership]]: Which team is responsible for each touchpoint

### Types of Journey Maps

- [[Current State Journey Map]]

  - Documents experience as it is today
  - Reveals existing pain points
  - Based on research and data
  - Most common type

- [[Future State Journey Map]]

  - Envisions ideal experience after improvements
  - Aspirational, goal-focused
  - Used for planning and aligning on vision

- [[Day in the Life]]

  - Broader than product-specific journey
  - Documents user's entire day or routine
  - Reveals context and adjacent needs
  - Helps identify where product fits into life

- [[Service Blueprint]]
  - Extension of journey map
  - Includes backstage processes and systems
  - Shows what happens behind the scenes to deliver experience
  - More operational than standard journey map

### Creating a Journey Map: Process

**Step 1: Define Scope**

- Which persona?
- Which journey/scenario?
- Time frame (hours, days, months)?
- Level of detail?

**Step 2: Gather Research Data**

- Conduct [[User-Interviews]]
- Review [[Usability-Testing]] findings
- Analyze [[Analytics]] (behavior data)
- Review [[Surveys]]
- Observe users ([[Contextual Inquiry]])
- Collect quotes, stories, pain points

**Step 3: Identify Phases**

- What are the major stages?
- Common frameworks:
  - Awareness → Consideration → Purchase → Retention → Advocacy
  - Pre-Service → Service → Post-Service
  - Discovery → Onboarding → Usage → Mastery → Advocacy
- Adapt to your specific journey

**Step 4: Map Touchpoints & Actions**

- For each phase, what does the user do?
- Where do they interact with product/service?
- List chronologically

**Step 5: Add Thoughts & Emotions**

- What's the user thinking?
- How do they feel?
- Use research quotes as evidence
- Create emotion curve (high points and low points)

**Step 6: Identify Pain Points**

- Where does experience break down?
- Friction, confusion, frustration
- Dead ends, errors, unmet needs
- Mark visually (icons, colors)

**Step 7: Spot Opportunities**

- For each pain point, ask: "How might we improve this?"
- Identify moments that matter most
- Prioritize by impact and feasibility

**Step 8: Visualize**

- Create diagram (horizontally oriented often)
- Use clear labels, icons, colors
- Make it scannable and engaging
- Include research evidence (quotes, photos)

**Step 9: Validate**

- Review with research participants if possible
- Does this ring true?
- Share with team for feedback

**Step 10: Socialize & Use**

- Present to stakeholders
- Print and display (make it visible)
- Use to inform design decisions
- Update as you learn more

### Journey Mapping Best Practices

- [[Ground in Research]]

  - Base on real data, not assumptions

  - Revisit regularly

### Analyzing Journey Maps

- [[Emotion Curve Analysis]]

  - Where are the peaks (delights)?
  - Where are the valleys (frustrations)?
  - What causes emotional swings?

- [[Gap Identification]]

  - What's missing?
  - Where do users need help but don't get it?
  - Touchpoints that don't exist but should?

- [[Prioritization]]

  - Which pain points impact the most users?
  - Which are most severe?
  - Which are easiest to address?
  - Impact × Feasibility matrix

- [[Moment that Matters]]
  - Critical touchpoints that make or break experience
  - Examples: First impression, key decision point, moment of truth
  - Invest in these moments

## Practice Exercises

1. **Simple Journey:** Map your own experience ordering food delivery (awareness → order → delivery → eating). Include: actions, thoughts, emotions (curve), touchpoints. Identify 3 pain points.

2. **Research-Based Map:** Conduct 3 [[User-Interviews]] about online shopping experiences. Synthesize into a journey map: 5 phases, touchpoints, quotes, emotion curve, pain points, opportunities.

3. **Before & After:** Choose a service you use. Create two journey maps: Current state (as-is) and Future state (ideal). Highlight improvements. How would you measure success?

4. **Emotion Curve Analysis:** Find 3 public journey maps online (search "customer journey map examples"). Analyze emotion curves. What causes peaks and valleys? How do designers respond to pain points?

5. **Workshop Facilitation:** Facilitate a journey mapping workshop with 3-5 colleagues. Choose a shared experience (e.g., conference attendance, onboarding at work). Collaborate to create map with all components.

6. **Prioritization Exercise:** Take a completed journey map. Identify all pain points (aim for 8-10). Prioritize using impact (high/medium/low) × feasibility (easy/medium/hard). Select top 3 to address. Justify your choices.
