# UX Research

## Introduction

UX Research is the systematic investigation of users and their requirements to inform the design process. It uncovers who users are, what they need, how they behave, and why they make certain decisions. Through observation, interviews, testing, and analysis, UX research transforms assumptions into evidence-based insights that drive design decisions. It answers critical questions: Are we building the right thing? Are we building it right?

UX research exists on a spectrum from generative (discovering problems and opportunities) to evaluative (testing solutions). Generative research happens early—exploring user needs, pain points, and contexts through methods like [[User-Interviews]], [[Contextual Inquiry]], and [[Surveys]]. Evaluative research happens later—validating designs through [[Usability-Testing]], [[A/B Testing]], and analytics. Both types are essential for creating products that truly serve users.

The most successful products are built on a foundation of continuous research. Research isn't a one-time phase but an ongoing practice woven throughout the design process. It prevents costly mistakes, builds empathy, reduces risk, and ensures that design decisions are grounded in real user needs rather than assumptions or personal preferences.

## Key Knowledge Points

### Research Fundamentals

- [[UX Research]]

  - Systematic study of target users
  - Methods: observation, interviews, testing, analytics
  - Goals:
    - Understand user needs, behaviors, motivations
    - Validate or invalidate assumptions
    - Inform design decisions with evidence
    - Reduce risk and improve outcomes

- **Types of Research:**

  - [[Generative Research]] (Discovery, Exploratory)

    - "What problems exist?"
    - Uncover needs and opportunities
    - Methods: interviews, field studies, diary studies
    - Phase: Early (before solutions)

  - [[Evaluative Research]] (Validation)
    - "Does this solution work?"
    - Test designs and measure success
    - Methods: usability testing, A/B tests, analytics
    - Phase: Later (during/after design)

- [[Qualitative Research]]

  - **What it is:** Non-numerical data about attitudes, behaviors, motivations
  - **Methods:** Interviews, observations, usability tests
  - **Strengths:** Depth, context, "why" questions
  - **Output:** Themes, insights, quotes, stories
  - **Sample size:** Small (5-12 participants often sufficient)

- [[Quantitative Research]]

  - **What it is:** Numerical data that can be measured and analyzed statistically
  - **Methods:** Surveys, analytics, A/B tests
  - **Strengths:** Scale, statistical significance, "how many" questions
  - **Output:** Metrics, percentages, correlations
  - **Sample size:** Large (hundreds to thousands)

- **When to Use Each:**
  - Qualitative: Understanding context, discovering problems, exploring "why"
  - Quantitative: Measuring impact, validating at scale, prioritizing
  - **Best practice:** Use both (mixed methods)

### Research Planning

- [[Research Questions]]

  - Clear, specific questions research should answer
  - Examples:
    - "What are the main pain points in our checkout flow?"
    - "How do users currently solve [problem]?"
    - "Is the new navigation more usable than the old one?"
  - Avoid leading questions
  - Focus on user needs, not solutions

- [[Research Goals]]

  - What decisions will this research inform?
  - What will you do with the findings?
  - How will success be measured?

- [[Research Plan]]

  - **Includes:**
    - Background and objectives
    - Research questions
    - Methodology (which methods, why)
    - Participants (who, how many, how recruited)
    - Timeline and resources
    - Analysis approach
    - Deliverables

- [[Participant Recruitment]]
  - Define target users (demographics, behaviors, needs)
  - Recruitment methods:
    - [[User Panels]]
    - [[Social Media]]
    - [[Email Lists]]
    - [[Recruitment Services]] (UserTesting, Respondent.io)
  - [[Screener Survey]]: Qualify participants
  - [[Incentives]]: Compensation for time ($50-150/hour typical)

### Research Methods

#### Qualitative Methods

- [[User-Interviews]]

  - One-on-one conversations with users
  - 30-60 minutes
  - Semi-structured (prepared questions + follow-ups)
  - Uncover needs, motivations, pain points
  - See [[User-Interviews]]

- [[Contextual Inquiry]]

  - Observe users in their natural environment
  - Watch them perform tasks
  - Ask questions about what they're doing
  - Reveals workarounds, context, real behavior

- [[Focus Groups]]

  - Group discussion (6-10 participants)
  - Facilitator guides conversation
  - **Pros:** Efficient, group dynamics spark ideas
  - **Cons:** Groupthink, dominant voices, not natural behavior
  - Less common in UX (interviews preferred)

- [[Diary Studies]]

  - Users log experiences over time (days to weeks)
  - Captures longitudinal behavior
  - Good for infrequent actions or context-dependent behavior

- [[Usability-Testing]]

  - Watch users attempt tasks with a prototype/product
  - Identify usability issues
  - "Think aloud" protocol
  - See [[Usability-Testing]]

- [[Card-Sorting]]
  - Users organize topics into categories
  - Informs [[Information-Architecture]]
  - See [[Card-Sorting]]

#### Quantitative Methods

- [[Surveys]]

  - Online questionnaires
  - Large sample sizes
  - Measure attitudes, behaviors, demographics
  - Multiple choice, rating scales, open-ended
  - See [[Surveys]]

- [[Analytics]]

  - Behavioral data from product usage
  - Tools: Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Amplitude
  - Metrics: page views, conversion rates, drop-off points
  - Shows _what_ users do, not _why_

- [[A/B Testing]]

  - Compare two versions (A vs B)
  - Randomly assign users
  - Measure which performs better (conversion, engagement, etc.)
  - Statistical significance required

- [[Tree Testing]]

  - Test [[Information-Architecture]] without visual design
  - Users find items in a text-only hierarchy
  - Measures findability

- [[First-Click Testing]]
  - Where do users click first for a task?
  - Measures intuitiveness
  - See [[Affordances]]

### Research Execution

- [[Interview Techniques]]

  - **Open-ended questions:** "Tell me about..." "How do you..."
  - **Avoid leading questions:** Not "Do you like...", ask "What do you think of..."
  - **Follow up:** "Why?" "Tell me more." "Can you give an example?"
  - **Listen more than talk:** 80/20 rule
  - **Silence is OK:** Let participants think
  - **Neutral body language**

- [[Think Aloud Protocol]]

  - Ask users to verbalize thoughts as they work
  - Reveals mental models, confusion, expectations
  - Common in [[Usability-Testing]]

- [[Recording & Note-Taking]]
  - Always ask permission to record
  - Video captures facial expressions, gestures
  - Audio sufficient if video not possible
  - Dedicated note-taker frees interviewer to focus
  - Note: verbatim quotes, observations, timestamps

### Research Analysis

- [[Qualitative Analysis]]

  - **Transcription:** Convert audio to text (tools: Otter.ai, Rev)
  - **Coding:** Tag quotes with themes/topics
  - **Affinity Mapping:** Group similar insights
    - Write insights on sticky notes
    - Group into themes
    - Identify patterns
  - **Themes:** Recurring patterns across participants
  - **Quotes:** Evidence for themes

- [[Quantitative Analysis]]

  - **Descriptive statistics:** Mean, median, mode, percentages
  - **Visualization:** Charts, graphs
  - **Significance testing:** Is difference real or chance?
  - Tools: Excel, Google Sheets, SPSS, R

### Research Best Practices

- **Start with Questions, Not Methods:**

  - What do you need to learn?
  - Then choose appropriate methods

- **Recruit Real Users:**

  - Not just friends/family/coworkers
  - Match target audience

- **Sample Size:**

  - Qualitative: 5-8 participants per user group (diminishing returns after)
  - Quantitative: Hundreds minimum for statistical validity

- **Avoid Bias:**

  - Don't lead participants to answers you want
  - Present neutral options
  - Test with diverse users

- **Test Early and Often:**

  - Don't wait for perfection
  - Low-fidelity prototypes are testable
  - Iterate based on findings

- **Collaborate:**

  - Involve team in research (build empathy)
  - Developers, PMs, stakeholders observe sessions

- **Make Research Visible:**
  - Share findings widely
  - Create highlight reels
  - Post quotes and insights in shared spaces

### Research Ethics

- [[Informed Consent]]

  - Explain purpose, what you'll do with data
  - Voluntary participation
  - Right to withdraw anytime

- [[Privacy]]

  - Anonymize data
  - Secure storage
  - Don't share identifying information without permission

- [[Compensation]]
  - Fair payment for time
  - Provide regardless of "good" or "bad" feedback
