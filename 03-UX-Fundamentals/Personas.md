# Personas

## Introduction

Personas are fictional yet realistic characters that represent distinct user types who might interact with your product. Based on [[User-Research]] rather than assumptions, personas synthesize patterns in behaviors, goals, pain points, and contexts into memorable archetypes. Instead of designing for "users" (vague and abstract), designers create for "Sarah, a busy parent who shops online late at night" or "Marcus, a tech-savvy early adopter frustrated by slow apps." Personas make users human, tangible, and impossible to ignore.

Personas serve as decision-making tools and empathy builders. When facing design choices—"Should we add this feature?" "How should navigation work?"—teams reference personas: "Would Sarah find this useful? Would Marcus understand this?" They prevent designing for ourselves or for imaginary users. By grounding decisions in research-backed archetypes, personas keep teams aligned and user-centered. They're not demographic profiles (age, gender, location) but psychological and behavioral portraits (goals, motivations, frustrations).

Effective personas are specific, evidence-based, and few in number. Creating 20 personas dilutes focus; 3-5 distinct personas force prioritization and clarity. Each persona represents a meaningful segment with different needs or behaviors. The goal isn't to document every possible user but to capture the most important patterns that will inform design decisions. When done well, personas become part of team vocabulary: "We're building this for Sarah, not Marcus."

## Learning Objectives

By mastering Personas, you will be able to:

- Conduct [[User-Research]] to identify meaningful user segments
- Analyze research data to extract behavior patterns, goals, and pain points
- Create realistic, research-based personas with appropriate detail
- Determine the right number and types of personas for a project
- Use personas to guide design decisions and prioritization
- Communicate personas effectively to cross-functional teams
- Distinguish between proto-personas (assumption-based) and research-based personas
- Avoid common persona pitfalls (stereotypes, too many, too vague)

## Key Knowledge Points

### Persona Fundamentals

- [[Persona]]

  - Fictional character representing a user segment
  - Based on research patterns, not assumptions
  - Includes: name, photo, background, goals, behaviors, pain points, context
  - **Purpose:**
    - Build empathy
    - Focus design decisions
    - Align team on who we're designing for
    - Communicate research insights memorably

- **When to Create Personas:**

  - After [[User-Research]] (synthesis step)
  - Early in project (guides design direction)
  - When multiple user types exist
  - To align stakeholders on user needs

- **Personas vs:**
  - [[User Segments]]: Personas add narrative and humanity to segments
  - [[User Profiles]]: Personas are specific individuals, not general descriptions
  - [[Stereotypes]]: Personas are evidence-based, not assumptions or clichés

### What Goes Into a Persona

**Essential Elements:**

1. [[Name & Photo]]

   - Memorable, realistic name
   - Photo makes them feel real (stock photo OK)
   - Humanizes the archetype

2. [[Role / Title]]

   - Job or life role
   - Context for their needs
   - Example: "Marketing Manager," "College Student," "Retiree"

3. [[Demographics (Context)]]

   - Age, location, education
   - **Important:** Only include if relevant to design decisions
   - Don't lead with demographics (leads to stereotyping)

4. [[Behavioral Characteristics]]

   - How they behave with similar products
   - Tech savviness
   - Frequency of use
   - Preferences
   - Example: "Checks email 50+ times/day," "Prefers phone calls over texts"

5. [[Goals & Motivations]]

   - What are they trying to achieve?
   - Why do they need this product?
   - Life goals and product goals
   - Example: "Save time on meal planning," "Advance career"

6. [[Pain Points & Frustrations]]

   - Problems they face
   - What frustrates them about current solutions?
   - Unmet needs
   - Example: "Overwhelmed by too many options," "Doesn't trust online reviews"

7. [[Context / Environment]]

   - Where/when do they use product?
   - Distractions, constraints
   - Example: "Uses phone on crowded subway commute," "Works from home with kids nearby"

8. [[Quote]]
   - Memorable statement capturing their mindset
   - Actual quote from research if possible
   - Example: "I just want something that works without having to read a manual"

**Optional Elements:**

- [[Tech Comfort Level]]: Novice, intermediate, expert
- [[Personality Traits]]: Introvert/extrovert, risk-averse/adventurous
- [[Brands They Use]]: Signals lifestyle and values
- [[Scenario / Day in the Life]]: Narrative showing context
- [[Needs Statement]]: "[Persona] needs [need] in order to [goal]"

### Creating Personas: Process

**Step 1: Conduct Research**

- [[User-Interviews]] (see [[User-Interviews]])
- [[Surveys]] (see [[Surveys]])
- [[Analytics]] (behavior data)
- [[Contextual Inquiry]] (observe in context)
- Sample: 10-30 users minimum

**Step 2: Identify Patterns**

- Review research notes, transcripts
- Look for commonalities:
  - Similar goals?
  - Similar behaviors?
  - Similar pain points?
  - Similar contexts?
- [[Affinity Mapping]]: Group similar insights

**Step 3: Segment Users**

- Group users with similar patterns
- **Segmentation criteria:**
  - Goals (what they're trying to achieve)
  - Behaviors (how they use product)
  - Attitudes (their mindset and values)
  - **Not just demographics** (age/gender alone insufficient)
- Aim for 3-5 distinct segments

**Step 4: Define Each Persona**

- For each segment, create one persona
- Pull real data from research:
  - Actual goals mentioned
  - Actual pain points observed
  - Actual quotes
- Name, photo, narrative details make it memorable

**Step 5: Validate**

- Review with research participants if possible
- Does this ring true?
- Share with team: Does this match their understanding?

**Step 6: Socialize**

- Create visual persona cards or posters
- Present to stakeholders
- Print and display (make personas visible)
- Reference in meetings and decisions

### Types of Personas

- [[Research-Based Personas]]

  - Grounded in real user research
  - Evidence-backed
  - Most reliable
  - **When:** After conducting research

- [[Proto-Personas]]

  - Assumption-based (team's best guesses)
  - Placeholder until research happens
  - Useful for aligning team early
  - **Risk:** May be wrong
  - **When:** No time/budget for research yet (but plan to validate)

- [[Primary vs Secondary Personas]]
  - **Primary:** Main target, highest priority
  - **Secondary:** Important but not primary focus
  - **Anti-Persona:** Who we're NOT designing for (clarifies scope)

### How Many Personas?

- **Sweet Spot: 3-5 personas**

  - Fewer than 3: May miss important segments
  - More than 5: Dilutes focus, hard to prioritize

- **Quality over Quantity:**

  - Better to have 3 well-researched, distinct personas
  - Than 10 vague, overlapping ones

- **Primary Persona:**
  - If must choose one, who's most important?
  - Who represents largest or most valuable segment?

### Using Personas in Design

**Decision-Making:**

- "Would Sarah find this feature valuable?"
- "Can Marcus complete this task?"
- "Does this language resonate with our personas?"

**Prioritization:**

- Features that serve primary persona = high priority
- Features only for secondary persona = lower priority

**Design Reviews:**

- "How does this solve Sarah's pain point?"
- Walk through designs from persona perspective

**User Stories:**

- "As Sarah (busy parent), I want to save recipes so that I can quickly find them later"
- Personas inform [[Agile]] user stories

**Scenarios:**

- Create usage scenarios with personas
- "Sarah arrives home at 6 PM, needs dinner idea in 5 minutes..."
- Guides [[User-Flows]] and [[Journey-Maps]]

### Persona Best Practices

- [[Base on Research, Not Assumptions]]

  - Real data > stereotypes
  - Include evidence (quotes, data points)

- [[Focus on Behaviors and Goals]]

  - Not just demographics
  - Why they do what they do

- [[Make Them Specific]]

  - ✅ "Sarah checks her phone while waiting in line, often in stores"
  - ❌ "Sarah is a millennial who likes technology"

- [[Keep Them Few]]

  - 3-5 personas
  - Each should be meaningfully different

- [[Make Them Memorable]]

  - Name, photo, quote
  - Tell a story
  - Team should remember them

- [[Keep Them Visible]]

  - Posters on wall
  - Reference in meetings
  - Living documents, not forgotten PDFs

- [[Update as You Learn]]
  - Personas aren't static
  - Refine with new research
  - Retire personas that no longer fit

### Common Pitfalls

- **Too Many Personas:**

  - Can't prioritize or focus
  - Solution: Consolidate into 3-5 distinct types

- **Demographics-Heavy:**

  - "Female, 25-35, urban" doesn't tell you about goals or behaviors
  - Solution: Lead with behaviors, goals, pain points

- **Stereotypes:**

  - "Tech-illiterate senior," "Lazy millennial"
  - Solution: Use real research, avoid caricatures

- **Assumption-Based:**

  - "We think our users are..."
  - Solution: Talk to real users

- **Too Vague:**

  - "Users want simple, fast, easy"
  - Solution: Be specific about context, goals, behaviors

- **One-and-Done:**
  - Create personas, then forget them
  - Solution: Reference regularly, keep visible, update

### Persona Formats

**One-Page Persona Card:**

- Most common
- All key info on one page
- Easy to print and share

**Persona Poster:**

- Larger, more visual
- Display in office
- Constant reminder

**Persona Slide Deck:**

- Detailed presentation
- For stakeholder alignment
- Includes research evidence

**Interactive Persona:**

- Digital, clickable

## Practice Exercises

1. **Proto-Persona:** Without research, create 3 proto-personas for a fitness app. Include: name, photo, goals, behaviors, pain points. What assumptions are you making? How would you validate?

2. **Research-Based Persona:** Conduct 5 [[User-Interviews]] about online shopping habits. Identify patterns. Create 2-3 personas based on findings. Include quotes from interviews as evidence.

3. **Persona Comparison:** Find 3 persona examples online (search "persona examples"). Critique: What's effective? What's missing? Too vague or too specific? Based on research or assumptions?

4. **Segmentation Practice:** Given this data about 10 users (create fictional profiles with goals, behaviors, pain points), identify 3 distinct segments. Create one persona for each segment. Justify your segmentation logic.

5. **Decision-Making:** Using personas you created, evaluate 5 feature ideas. For each feature, assess: Does this solve [Persona]'s pain point? Would [Persona] use this? Prioritize features based on persona needs.

6. **Persona Evolution:** Choose a real product you use. Create a persona based on your understanding. Then interview 3 actual users. How does reality differ from your assumption-based persona? Revise based on findings.
