# Design Thinking

## Introduction

Design Thinking is a human-centered, iterative problem-solving framework that emphasizes empathy, experimentation, and collaboration. It's both a mindset and a structured process: start by deeply understanding people and their needs, creatively generate many possible solutions, prototype quickly, test with real users, and iterate based on feedback. Design Thinking moves beyond guessing what users want—it involves them throughout, ensuring solutions address real problems rather than assumed ones.

Originally pioneered by IDEO and Stanford's d.school, Design Thinking has spread far beyond product design into business strategy, social innovation, education, and more. Its power lies in making the abstract concrete: turning vague challenges into defined problems, wild ideas into testable prototypes, and assumptions into validated insights. It democratizes innovation—anyone can use this framework, not just designers—and emphasizes that the best solutions emerge from understanding humans first, technology second.

The framework typically consists of five phases: Empathize (understand users), Define (frame the problem), Ideate (generate solutions), Prototype (make it tangible), and Test (learn and iterate). These phases aren't strictly linear—teams loop back, revisit earlier stages, and cycle through until they converge on solutions that genuinely improve people's lives. It's this iterative, human-first approach that makes Design Thinking transformative.

## Key Knowledge Points

### Design Thinking Fundamentals

- [[Design Thinking]]

  - Human-centered approach to innovation and problem-solving
  - Iterative, not linear (loop back through stages)
  - Emphasizes:
    - [[Empathy]]: Understand people deeply
    - [[Experimentation]]: Test ideas, fail fast, learn
    - [[Collaboration]]: Diverse perspectives
    - [[Bias Toward Action]]: Make things, don't just talk

- **Core Principles:**

  - [[Human-Centered]]: Start with people, not technology
  - [[Show Don't Tell]]: Prototypes over presentations
  - [[Radical Collaboration]]: Involve diverse voices
  - [[Embrace Failure]]: Learn from experiments
  - [[Bias to Action]]: Doing beats discussing

- **When to Use Design Thinking:**
  - Complex, ambiguous problems
  - New product/feature development
  - Reimagining existing experiences
  - When user needs are unclear
  - Cross-functional innovation challenges
  - Social innovation and systemic problems

### The Five Stages

#### 1. Empathize

- [[Empathize]]
  - Understand users deeply
  - Observe, engage, immerse
  - Set aside assumptions
  - Build empathy for user needs, motivations, pain points, context

**Methods:**

- [[User-Interviews]]: One-on-one conversations (see [[User-Interviews]])
- [[Observation]]: Watch users in their environment
- [[Contextual Inquiry]]: Observe + ask questions in context
- [[Shadowing]]: Follow users through their day
- [[Empathy Mapping]]: Capture what users say, think, do, feel
- [[Photo/Video Ethnography]]: Visual documentation of experiences

**Key Questions:**

- What do users do, think, feel?
- What are their goals and motivations?
- What frustrates them?
- What's their context and environment?

**Output:** Research notes, quotes, observations, photos, empathy maps

#### 2. Define

- [[Define]]
  - Synthesize research into insights
  - Frame the problem clearly
  - Create actionable problem statement
  - Focus: right problem > jumping to solutions

**Activities:**

- [[Affinity Mapping]]: Group insights into themes
- [[Persona]] creation: Archetypes of users
- [[Journey Mapping]]: Visualize experience over time (see [[Journey-Maps]])
- [[Point of View (POV) Statement]]: "[User] needs [need] because [insight]"
- [[How Might We (HMW)]]: Reframe problem as opportunities

**Problem Statement Format:**

- **POV:** "[Persona] needs a way to [need] because [surprising insight]"
- Example: "Sarah, a busy parent, needs a way to quickly find healthy recipes because she feels overwhelmed by too many options and limited time."

**How Might We Questions:**

- Turn problems into opportunities
- Open-ended, not prescriptive
- **Examples:**
  - Problem: Users abandon checkout due to unexpected fees
  - HMW: "How might we make costs transparent upfront?"
  - HMW: "How might we reduce surprise and build trust in pricing?"

**Output:** POV statement, HMW questions, personas, journey maps

#### 3. Ideate

- [[Ideate]]
  - Generate many diverse ideas
  - Defer judgment (no bad ideas yet)
  - Encourage wild ideas
  - Build on others' ideas
  - Go for quantity over quality (at first)

**Ideation Techniques:**

- [[Brainstorming]]

  - Rapid idea generation
  - Rules: Defer judgment, encourage wild ideas, build on others, stay focused

- [[Brainwriting]]

  - Silent brainstorming (write ideas on paper)
  - Pass to next person who builds on ideas
  - Good for introverts or avoiding dominant voices

- [[Mind Mapping]]

  - Visual diagram branching from central problem
  - Associations and connections

- [[SCAMPER]]

  - Prompts: Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other use, Eliminate, Reverse
  - Example: "What if we eliminated the sign-up process?"

- [[Worst Possible Idea]]

  - Brainstorm terrible solutions (loosens up group)
  - Reverse them into good ideas

- [[Analogies]]
  - "How would [company/industry] solve this?"
  - Example: "How would Disney approach onboarding?"

**Facilitating Ideation:**

- Set time limits (5-10 min bursts)
- Use prompts and HMW questions
- Encourage sketching (visual ideas)
- Build on ideas ("Yes, and...")
- Cluster similar ideas
- Dot voting to prioritize

**Output:** 50-200+ ideas (quantity!), clustered themes, shortlist of top ideas

#### 4. Prototype

- [[Prototype]]
  - Make ideas tangible
  - Fast, cheap, rough
  - Purpose: Learn, not perfect
  - "Think with your hands"

**Fidelity Levels:**

- [[Low-Fidelity]]

  - Paper sketches
  - Cardboard mockups
  - Storyboards
  - Wizard of Oz (human simulates system)
  - **When:** Very early, test concepts

- [[Medium-Fidelity]]

  - Clickable wireframes
  - Simple digital prototypes (Figma, Adobe XD)
  - **When:** Refine interactions, flows

- [[High-Fidelity]]
  - Polished designs
  - Realistic interactions
  - See [[Prototyping]], [[Hi-Fi-Prototyping]]
  - **When:** Validate final design before build

**Prototyping Principles:**

- Build to think and learn
- Start rough, refine only what needs it
- Fail fast, fail cheap
- One prototype per idea/concept (test multiple)
- Prototype just enough to test assumptions

**Prototype Types:**

- [[Concept Prototype]]: Communicates the idea
- [[Functional Prototype]]: Tests a feature or interaction
- [[Experience Prototype]]: Simulates context (e.g., use in car, kitchen)

**Output:** Testable prototypes (paper, digital, physical)

#### 5. Test

- [[Test]]
  - Put prototypes in front of users
  - Observe how they interact
  - Gather feedback
  - Learn what works, what doesn't
  - Iterate: Improve, test again

**Testing Approach:**

- Show prototype to users (target personas)
- Give them tasks: "Try to book an appointment"
- Observe, ask questions
- [[Think Aloud Protocol]]: "Tell me what you're thinking"
- Note: Confusion, errors, delight, suggestions

**Testing Methods:**

- [[Usability-Testing]]: Can they use it? (see [[Usability-Testing]])
- [[Concept Testing]]: Do they understand the value?
- [[A/B Testing]]: Which version performs better?
- [[Feedback Sessions]]: Open reactions and discussion

**Key Questions:**

- Do users understand the concept?
- Can they complete tasks?
- What's confusing?
- What do they like/dislike?
- Does this solve their problem?

**After Testing:**

- [[Iterate]]: Refine prototype based on feedback
- Go back to earlier stages if needed:
  - New insights → Empathize or Define
  - Solution doesn't work → Ideate
  - Prototype inadequate → Prototype again
- Repeat cycle until solution works

**Output:** Insights, validated/invalidated assumptions, improved prototypes

### Iterative Nature

- Design Thinking is **non-linear**
- Loop back through stages:
  - Test reveals new insight → Empathize again
  - Problem reframed → Define again
  - Solution fails → Ideate new approaches
- [[Divergent vs Convergent Thinking]]
  - **Divergent:** Expand possibilities (Empathize, Ideate)
  - **Convergent:** Narrow to solutions (Define, Prototype, Test)
  - Cycle between both

### Design Thinking Mindsets

- [[Beginner's Mind]]

  - Approach with fresh eyes
  - Set aside expertise and assumptions
  - Ask "why?" like a child

- [[Bias Toward Action]]

  - Don't overthink, start doing
  - Prototypes over endless planning

- [[Embrace Ambiguity]]

  - Comfort with not knowing
  - Complex problems have messy starts
  - Clarity emerges through process

- [[Optimism]]

  - Believe solutions exist
  - Problems are opportunities

- [[Collaboration]]

  - Diverse perspectives improve outcomes
  - Build on others' ideas
  - Co-create with users, not for them

- [[Learn from Failure]]
  - Experiments that "fail" provide insights
  - Fail fast, learn fast
  - Iteration is improvement

### Design Thinking in Practice

**Workshop Format:**

- Often conducted as multi-day workshops (Design Sprint)
- Cross-functional team (designers, developers, business, users)
- Facilitated process through all stages
- Outputs: Problem definition, prototypes, user feedback, roadmap

**Design Sprint (Google Ventures):**

- 5-day structured process
- Monday: Map problem
- Tuesday: Sketch solutions
- Wednesday: Decide on solution
- Thursday: Prototype
- Friday: Test with users
- See "Sprint" by Jake Knapp

**Integrating into Product Development:**

- Kickoff projects with empathy research
- Regular ideation sessions for features
- Rapid prototyping before dev investment
- Continuous user testing

### Common Pitfalls

- **Skipping Empathy:**

  - Jumping to solutions without understanding users
  - Solution: Invest time in research

- **Falling in Love with Ideas:**

  - Defending concepts instead of testing them
  - Solution: Test early, let users decide

- **Prototyping Too Slowly:**

  - Perfectionism delays learning
  - Solution: Embrace rough prototypes

- **Not Iterating:**

  - Testing once and stopping
  - Solution: Cycle through multiple times

- **Homogeneous Teams:**

  - Same perspectives limit creativity
  - Solution: Involve diverse voices

- **Ignoring Constraints:**
  - Ideas that aren't feasible
  - Solution: Balance desirability, feasibility, viability (see [[Design Constraints]])

## Practice Exercises

1. **Mini Design Sprint:** Choose a problem (e.g., "reduce food waste at home"). Spend 1 hour per stage: Empathize (interview 2 people), Define (write POV + HMW), Ideate (50 ideas), Prototype (paper), Test (show 2 people). Document learnings.

2. **Empathy Challenge:** Shadow someone for 2 hours as they work/shop/commute. Document observations. Create empathy map. Identify 3 pain points. Write HMW questions.

3. **Ideation Practice:** Choose a HMW question (e.g., "How might we make public transit more enjoyable?"). Use 3 different ideation techniques (brainstorming, SCAMPER, worst possible idea). Generate 100 ideas total. Cluster and dot vote.

4. **Rapid Prototyping:** Choose an idea from Exercise 3. Create 3 different prototypes: paper, digital wireframe, storyboard. Test with 3 people. Which prototype communicated best? Why?

5. **Problem Reframing:** Take a common problem ("People don't exercise enough"). Interview 3 people about their relationship with exercise. Create POV statement from insights. Write 10 HMW questions. How did reframing change the problem?

6. **Full Cycle:** Pick a real problem you face. Complete all 5 stages over 5 days: Day 1 (Empathize - 3 interviews), Day 2 (Define - synthesis), Day 3 (Ideate - 50 ideas), Day 4 (Prototype - build it), Day 5 (Test - 5 users). Iterate once. Document journey.
